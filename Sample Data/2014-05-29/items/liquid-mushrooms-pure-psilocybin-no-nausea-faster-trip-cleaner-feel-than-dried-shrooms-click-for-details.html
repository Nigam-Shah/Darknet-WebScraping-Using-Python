<br />UPDATE 12 May 2014: Back in stock!</p>

<p>UPDATE 27 MAY 2014: I had a RUSH of orders over memorial weekend, and have run out of glass shipping vials and had to order more (although I have plenty of liquid still in this batch). So any orders made after yesterday will not ship until I can bottle the liquid - I expect the empty vials to arrive before the end of the week. I'm sorry for the delay, and I'll keep you posted if you order in this interrim. Thanks!</p>

<br />UPDATE 18 May 2014: WANT TO USE ESCROW?</p>

<p>I've created vendor accounts on a few markets that have either regular escrow or multisig escrow (Multisig is a tad more complicated to set up, but it's a way to be positive that your bitcoins are safe from attack/theft.)</p>

<p>TWS on Agora: http://agorahooawayyfoe.onion/p/E3XYLTFK0L (site escrow)
<br />TWS on Evolution: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/18319 (site & multisig escrow)
<br />TWS on TheMarketplace: http://7z7s2qezpj3rlrww.onion/product/tripwithscience/liquid-mushrooms-pure-psilocybin (multisig escrow)</p>

<p>If you buy from me anywhere else, just put a note with your address that you came from the Silk Road, and I'll throw in ONE FREE vial as a thank-you for supporting me on the 'new' site. I don't have enough vials to do this for very long, so this is a VERY limited-time offer.  </p>

<p>Either way, you still get the same great customer service, astounding product, and superior stealth wherever you find me. :D</p>

<p>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓</p>

<p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:</p>

<p>These vials contain Liquid Mushrooms (extracted Psilocybin in a clean ethanol/distilled water solution). Each vial contains ~9mg of Psilocybin (equivalent to the Psilocybin content of 2g of dried shrooms). So one vial contains enough psilocybin for a fun, solid trip, with plenty of visuals. If you are light weight (under 130 pounds) you might only need ¾ of a vial.</p>

<p>If you like hallucinogenic mushrooms, but have never tried the pure form, you are in for a TREAT! </p>

<p>(And if you’ve never tried mushrooms before, then this is the best way to start out to see if you’ll like the effects)</p>

<p>╔════════════════════════════════╗
<br />║██    WHY IS LIQUID PSILOCYBIN BETTER?  ██║
<br />╚════════════════════════════════╝
<br />The benefit of taking the liquid is that Psilocybe Cubensis and other hallucinogenic mushrooms have evolved natural chemicals that prevent digestion by mammals (so that when an animal in the wild eats a mushroom it won’t digest the spores, so the undigested spores pass through the animal and wind up intact in the excrement, and new mushrooms can grow there).</p>

<p>This means that for most of us mammals, eating mushrooms will give us an upset stomach. By extracting the psilocybin, you don’t have to pass through the nausea that sometimes accompanies the beginning of a trip.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that since your body doesn’t have to break down the bonds of the psilocybin from the plant material, you will begin to trip faster.</p>

<p>NOTE: While liquid Psilocybin doesn’t have the plant matter that causes upset stomachs, the drug IS serotonergic (more on that below) so most people still experience a “different” feeling in the stomach during the beginning of the trip.</p>

<p>And perhaps the greatest thing about liquid mushrooms is that you can ‘re-dose.’ After 3 or 4 hours when you feel yourself coming down, you can take some more, and you will come right back up. You can plan to trip for an entire day at low, enjoyable levels, just taking half a vial every 3 hours or so.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to re-dose by eating more mushrooms as you are coming down, you know that it doesn’t work as well as the first time. This is because the stomach is drastically slowing digestion, so the plant matter in your second dose of mushrooms will take much longer to digest, and therefore won’t be processed by your liver until much later. With pure psilocybin, you don’t have to wait on your silly ol’ stomach to digest everything.</p>

<p>╔═══════════════════════════════════╗
<br />║██    HOW ARE “LIQUID MUSHROOMS” MADE?    ██║
<br />╚═══════════════════════════════════╝
<br />These are regular hallucinogenic mushrooms (Cambodian and Golden Teacher races) that I’ve grown myself, dried, pulverized, then used an ethanol alcohol extraction method with a specialized funnel over multiple washes, and finally a controlled evaporation down to desired potency. It’s a time-consuming process, and takes about a month to do it right. </p>

<p>I know some people just want to get “fucked up” and this is a fun, safe way to do it. But if you are looking to explore the boundaries of the conscious mind, you may go into your trip knowing that every step in my production of this entheogenic medicine is done with careful intent, and with </p>

<p>║██    A note on how psilocybin works:  ██║</p>

<p>Psilocybin is a stable molecule, although heat and UV radiation can cause it to break down (which is why it’s best to store this liquid in the refrigerator out of sunlight). However, the actual drug that makes your brain trip is called “psilocin.” Which means that your body needs to convert the psilocybin into psilocin before you feel the effects. There are two main ways your body breaks it down:</p>

<p>1.	Strong acid (such as stomach acid)
<br />2.	Hepatic systems in the liver</p>

<p>If you take this liquid on an empty stomach, you will trip MUCH faster, since your stomach acid will break the psilocybin into psilocin right away. Expect to start feeling the effects in 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>If your stomach is full, or you just don’t happen to have a lot of spare stomach acid at the moment, the trip will start once the psilocybin gets to your liver, gets converted to psilocin, then into your bloodstream, and past the blood-brain barrier where it starts dancing with your serotonin receptors. This process usually takes about an hour.</p>

<p>A couple of other Benefits of Liquid Mushrooms:
<br />●	Taste: you can mix a vial in a cup of orange juice and it’s tasteless.
<br />●	When opened, the liquid smells like alcohol - it doesn’t look/smell like “drugs.” if Law Enforcement ever finds it you can claim it’s a homeopathic/Herbal/Natural tincture, such as the kind found in grocery stores. </p>

<br />║██    Mushroom Danger Misconceptions:   ██║
<br />╚═════════════════════════════╝
<br />You may have heard someone say “mushrooms are a poison”  - That is not a true statement. Magic Mushrooms are so safe that you can eat about 17 POUNDS of them before you are in danger of overdosing (or drink over 2,000 of these vials). You are more likely to overdose on drinking too much water than on mushrooms. (People have died from drinking too much water. No one has ever died from eating hallucinogenic mushrooms).</p>

<p>It’s the safest recreational drug there is (I’m not kidding: look the charts on the links below: You’ll see all the major recreational drugs color-coded by the dangers they pose to the human body/brain/psyche, and mushrooms are that tiny little blip on the end)</p>

<p>╔═══════════════════════╗
<br />║██    How to avoid a “Bad Trip”    ██║
<br />╚═══════════════════════╝</p>

<p>These rules are the same for regular Shrooms as well as liquid Psilocybin</p>

<p>██ Rule #1: Don’t combine alcohol and mushrooms (unless you’re really experienced with mushrooms). The reason for this is two-fold: 1 -  Alcohol is a depressant that acts on your entire central nervous system. Mushrooms slow down the part of your brain that normally acts as a filter for your conscious mind, so the two don’t compliment each other. Of course, mushrooms are so safe that you’re not hurting your body or brain by combining them, but alcohol makes it harder for you to control your thoughts and that can lead to mild psychological discomfort.</p>

<p>If you ever hear someone talk about their “bad trip,” ask them if they were drinking at the time. I’ll bet ya dollars to donuts that they had a few drinks before they started the trip. </p>

<p>██ Rule #2: Mindset. Whatever emotional/mental state you were in before you started tripping, you will probably continue on that path. But think of taking mushrooms this way: It’s like getting into a car that has the cruise control set at 40mph. You can steer the car wherever you want, but you can’t stop it or slow it down until it runs out of gas. So if you find yourself wanting the trip to stop because you’re feeling uncomfortable or worried about something, just remember that you can steer your mind somewhere else while you’re waiting for your body to finish metabolizing all of the psilocin - nothing can speed that process up. If you’re with someone and they’re having a bad trip, the easiest way to steer the mind somewhere else is to physically go to a different room. It works wonders. (keep in mind, if you are starting on the path to a ‘bad trip’ then you will NOT feel like moving. But walk into a different room anyway and start talking/thinking about something else. It’s magic.)</p>

<p>██ Rule #3: Setting. The location you choose for a hallucinogenic experience is very important. Your senses will be heightened (since the part of your brain that usually works to filter through your senses won’t be as active, so your conscious mind gets a LOT more input than it’s used to). So if you go someplace that is loud and has lots of lights/movement it can be overwhelming. The best place is somewhere you feel safe. If you’re going to trip in public, be with some friends you trust. If you’re going to trip in a nightclub for the first time, take some earplugs just in case the music gets too overwhelming. You can pop them in, sit down and close your eyes for a minute and feel fine again.</p>

<p>Again, If you’re with a friend and they start to have a ‘bad trip’ or start to feel just a bit uneasy – the easiest thing to do is to take them by the hand and move them to a different room. They might resist you, saying “No, I have to stay here.” Just be calm, assuring, and tell them that they can come back if they want to, but at least try to move. Two minutes after being in a new room (or hallway, or bathroom or whatever) they will feel differently.</p>

<p>██ Be on the super-safe side: Have some (0.5mg ~ 1.0mg) powdered Xanax (Alprazolam) handy. If someone is having a “Bad Trip” it’s due to anxiety, they can snort the powder and feel better in minutes. Xanax is an anti-anxiety drug; it will dull the trip, but at least it won’t be a unpleasant anymore.</p>

<br />║██    ABOUT ME:  ██║
<br />╚══════════════╝</p>

<p>My name is Trip, and I’ve grown mushrooms for years. I’m fascinated by the possibilities of psilocybin: it can be used as a spiritual medicine to awaken barriers to our consciousness, and it can also make lights pretty and your friends funnier. </p>

<p>╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
<br />║██    A NOTE ON MY STEALTH / SECURITY PRECAUTIONS:   ██║
<br />╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝</p>

<p>I pride myself on shipping a quality product, on time, and in the UTMOST stealth possible. The psilocybin will come dissolved in a few milliliters of ethanol, in a little vial. Psilocybin is not a compound that drug-sniffing dogs can be trained on – and even if your package is opened by DEA/FBI/Nosy roommate, the contents will be disguised and innocuous. I routinely change my shipping methods and packages to avoid detection. </p>

<p>I understand that many of you have concerns with Vendors who use little or sub-par stealth, receiving packages that, when opened, show that little concern was made for the buyer’s safety. I want to ship your package in such a way that even if someone opens it LOOKING to see if it contains drugs they wouldn’t be sure. </p>

<p>I store my “Working files” on an encrypted drive that has an auto-timeout feature for my own security. This also protects you, since if (heaven forbid) I ever get investigated I will have no accessible evidence of any Silk Road activity on any computer.</p>

<p>After shipment, the encrypted copy of your address on the SR server is destroyed, and I no longer have access to it. I do not have any record on my computer of the transaction. So if I want to send you something extra in the mail (such as a thank-you gift for writing a trip report in your feedback) I will need to ask you for your address each time (after which it will be subsequently destroyed)</p>

<p>I have a copy of the tracking number that I save in case of a delivery problem. When I see you finalize your order I destroy the tracking number.</p>

<br />Trip Report Example from shroomery.org:</p>

<p>Me and my friend had managed to find a decent dealer to get liquid mushrooms from, and upon our first time buying from him, we bought 6 vails, as there were 3 of us tripping and we wanted to trip hard. each vail had the potency of 2 grams of mushrooms, i had tried normal mushrooms, but didnt eat enought so no effects happened. after drinking the vails, within 10 minutes, i started to feel diffrent. we decided we wanted to go for a walk throught the woods (at 10 pm on a surprising warm winter night) so we put on our coats and started journing. after 30 minutes apon taking the vail, everything started to change.... alot. trees were waving hello at me, and the moon had a big smile on it. the stars looked like diamonds (i asked my friend if we could climb up into the sky and take some). As i started hitting my peak, the houses around changed from color to color. orange to blue to red to green. they also seemed to be "dancing" as i explained it. We eventually got to the path for the trail throught the woods. we walked throught it, but stopped every 2 minutes or so, just to stare at the stars and trees around us. we did this for a couple hours and eventually made it too my friends house, were his big brother came out ( he is very experienced with shrooms, taking them alot) and gve me a smoke :P we all went into the woods behind his house, played some kid cudi, and smoked some weed and had a cig. after smoking tthe weed, everything intensified alot. we went to this random play ground, and just stared at the stars and passed a pipe around. we had half ounce and lots of time. we sat for hours and just smoked weed. eventually my othewr friend showed up drunk. as we started heading back to my house, an odd experience hit me. i seemed to come out of my body, and could see myself standing there in front of me. this scared me, then everything went bright, and i "zoomed" back into my body. i didnt get scared that bad and calmed down, and kept walking home with my friends. when we got to my house, i rolled a nice fat blunt, and got halfway throught it, when i tolded my drunk friend he could have the rest of it if he went home. he took it and left, and me and my friend layied in my bedroom. we didnt sleep for another hour and eventually passed out. this trip had been an amazing experience for me. being out on a warm night in the woods had made the shroom trip amazing!

<br />║██    Batch Information ██║
<br />╚═════════════════╝</p>

<p>I wait until I have a large quantity of dried shrooms (a mix of Cambodians and Golden Teachers) before processing them into liquid. As such, the liquid won’t change much in potency, since it is made from multiple harvests.</p>

<p>But if you are re-ordering from me and want to know if the liquid is coming from the same batch (and the silly code names I give each one), then you will find that information here:</p>

<p>Current Batch being sold: 10 May 2014 ("Duke Funderson")</p>

<p>Past Batches:
<br />1 March 2014 (“Mr. Blue Sky”) 
<br />5 November 2013 (“Mr. Remember” batch)
<br />25 April 2013 (the “King Spoodley” batch)
<br />4 January 2013 (the “Captain Adventure” batch)
<br />15 May 2012 (the “Admiral Blastoff” batch)
<br />11 December 2011 (the “Count Stardust” batch)
<br />1 July 2011 (the “Sgt. Voyage” batch)</p>

<br />║██    LIQUID MUSHROOMS FAQ:   ██║
<br />╚═════════════════════════╝
<br />Some questions I’ve had about Liquid Mushrooms. Let me know if you have any more!
<br />═════════════════════════
<br />Q: Should you take them on a full or empty stomach?
<br />A: Either one is fine. On an empty stomach you will trip faster (since your stomach acid will be able to break down the stable psilocybin to the psychoactive psilocin faster). On an empty stomach, your trip can begin in less than 10 minutes (although allow another hour for your body to process the rest and start bringing on your peak). </p>

<p>On a full stomach, expect 45 to 90 minutes for the effects – depending on your metabolism and how much you ate. As a side note, know that psilocin (the psychoactive compound) is serotonergic, which means that our stomach (which has a LOT of serotonin receptors) will respond to it faster than our brains will. In effect, your stomach will start ‘tripping’ before your brain does. That means that when your trip starts, the stomach will slow digestion down tremendously – you will not be processing food much during your trip. This is also why your appetite goes away during a mushroom trip. Your stomach isn’t signaling hunger to your brain. 
<br />═════════════════════════
<br />Q: Do u just drink it straight, or mix it with something?</p>

<p>A: You can shoot it straight from the vial, but it won’t taste very good (imagine mushroom-flavored everclear). But since the amount of liquid in the vial is so small (8ml), you can dump it into something as small as a shot glass of orange juice, Gatorade, soda, or any other drink and it will almost completely mask the taste. 
<br />═════════════════════════
<br />Q: Hey Trip, I usuall take an eighth [ounce] and trip balls. Is this the same?</p>

<p>A: One vial is equivalent to 2 grams dried. 1/8 ounce is 3.55 grams, so 1.75 vials will be roughly the same psilocybin content as an eighth. Keep in mind, however, that this will hit you faster (and harder) than psilocybin still bound to plants – so prepare accordingly. 
<br />═════════════════════════
<br />Q: How long does the liquid last before it loses potency?</p>

<p>A: Psilocybin is sensitive to heat and UV radiation. Normally the plant material itself shields the psilocybin from sunlight, but if you want to be extra safe, you can store it in the freezer. The vials I ship the liquid in are opaque to block some sunlight, but I wouldn’t leave them on the windowsill for weeks, or you will likely lose potency. I have personally had 1-year old liquid that I kept mostly in the refrigerator (It went with me to Burning Man and baked in the hot desert sun, then came back a week later unused) and it ended up being just as potent as ever.</p>
