<div class="container container_large" style="margin: 20px 0 40px;">
  <p>quick update: 5/08/2014: ok everyone, sorry for late replies, and no replies for some. ive had to put us in vacation mode for the past couple days for personal reasons, but we will most likely open back up tonight. i want everyone to know that we will get around to messages when we can. but as it is currently, we are taking care of the most important messages first(messages pertaining to current orders). im not sure what the limit on the inbox is, but if there IS one, weve gotta be close. theres hundreds of unread messages that need getting to, but we are working on it! (we are down to a 2 man team right now, and this may last for a little while. this means less time for messages. we are taking care of the most important things first, like getting you your product!!)</p>

<p>4/11/14: WTF is with the 1/5's?!?! selective scammer?!?! really?! EVERYONE RECEIVES THE SAME PRODUCT!! if something wasnt up to par with normal standards, MESSAGE ME FIRST! and if you did, give me more than 1-2 days to answer! some of you are ridiculous lol. i am NOT a selective scammer, and no one received talcom powder -__-. (now that i know what bags werent up to par, i can guarantee i wont be grabbing those batches! ive got plenty of the good gear now!)</p>

<p>also just want to add this.. i was told that the new bags were the SAME product as was in the old fire bags. i get all my product from the same people, but im learning recently that they are complete liars about their product. i dont do the stuff myself, so its really hard for me to judge. and unfortunately, its my customers, and my business, which suffers. i know what to avoid now though.. for future reference though people, all you have to do is message me. dont leave a 1/5 before doing so. i take care of my customers when i can. but if u a leave a 1/5 first.. dont expect anything from me.</p>

<p>OK! messages are going to be a little late. were about 3 days behind at the moment and there are over 200 messages to go through in total. theres been a new influx of customers, and with them came a TON of messages. we would really appreciate if people can stop asking stuff like "has the order been shipped?", "when will it get here you think?", "How potent is it?", "will you give samples?", "freebee plox...". i ALWAYS ship same day or next, and USPS can take their time sometimes. be patient. only message us in that fashion if its been at least a week after we mark it shipped! we will no longer be answering messages of that kind!</p>

<p> for the last 1/5.. really? sometimes you have to wait a day or two for an answer. im sorry that you had to wait and that your package took longer than expected. what happens after it leaves my hands is up to USPS. a little patience goes a long way.</p>

<p> for the person who left a 4/5.. they obviously dont know how to read (the package says priority all over it!) :p the package WAS sent priority, and sometimes USPS takes longer than i do to ship things. all my packages go out same day or next day, GUARANTEED! what USPS does after that is up to them. some people are SO impatient lol. (keep in mind there was a snow storm this week. this causes delays people.)</p>

<p>IMPORTANT INFO ON MESSAGING: due to the overwhelming amount of msgs we are receiving on a daily basis, we are implementing a new system; from this point on, only messages with the word 'bubbaloo' in the subject line will be acknowledged.. we are receiving far too many messages with questions that are answered right here in our profile and listings; if you use the keyword, we will know you have already checked our profile for an answer to your question and could not find one, thus actually requiring a response from our team. we will still do our best to respond to ALL messages,  but this is becoming more and more challenging each day. we appreciate your understanding and happy nods!</p>

<p>current news 3/24/2014: found a new way to process shipping which will work without my having to rely on anyone else. so issues like this should never arise from here on out! this new way is essentially more anonymous for everyone involved as well, so im sorry for being a little late on some orders, but we are improving with time!! thanks everyone!</p>

<p>FOR THOSE WHO LEFT FEEDBACK SAYING 'SCAMMER' ETC. WITH LESS THAN A 5/5, PLEASE MESSAGE ME. I AM NOT A SCAMMER AND ALL ORDERS HAVE GONE OUT. IF YOU CANT BE PATIENT FOR ONE WEEK WHILE I DEAL WITH REAL PROBLEMS, THAN I DONT WANT YOUR BUSINESS. THANKS. FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ME, I TRULY VALUE YOUR PRESENCE AND I GUARANTEE THE BEST SERVICE I CAN PROVIDE FOR ALL OF YOU!!</p>

<p>id like to add one more thing.. if i was a scammer.. WHY WOULD I PUT MYSELF INTO VACATION MODE WHILE I ATTEMPT TO FIX THE MESS I MADE? im sorry this happened.. but im doing my best. i am opening up business again as of today, but i am limiting orders on a daily basis from this point on.</p>

<p>(ALSO, FOR THOSE WHO LEFT LOW FEEDBACK, I EXPECT AN APOLOGY OR POST ON THE FORUMS WHEN YOU RECEIVE YOUR GEAR.. EVEN WITH THE BAD FEEDBACK, YOULL STILL BE RECEIVING YOUR ORDER. THANKS.)</p>

<p>PLEASE ENCRYPT ALL ADDRESSES WITH PGP!! I AM GOING TO BE CANCELING ORDERS THAT DONT FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE!! ENCRYPT ALL ADDRESSES USING PGP!!</p>

<p>please dont inquire with me on how to use pgp, i cant explain to everyone how it works! its easily learned if you go online and find a guide for properly encrypting messages for pgp. This keeps both the buyer and seller safe, and is crucial!
<br />thanks!</p>

<p>Lastly, just want everyone to know that we got a new shipment in, and it is very potent! Be careful when using, and make sure you don't go overboard right off the bat. Take it easy and pace yourself! We don't want people getting sick and leaving low reviews..</p>

<p>Thanks for understanding, and we hope everyone is doing alright under these dire circumstances!</p>

<p>Happy nods all!</p>

<p>Hey everyone, we are a new vendor here based in the US and currently only shipping within the US! We will mainly be dealing in strong New York heroin, and magic mushrooms. We will start off simple, with only a few basic listings, but as time goes by, and we get our feet off the ground, we will be putting out some unique listings as well as bulk orders etc.</p>

<p>As far as a shipping schedule goes, this is how things are going to be processed for the time being. This is not 100% concrete; this is a loose guideline, and depending on time constraints and how busy we are, we very well may ship out same day even if it is after 12pm. and we may ship on weekends as well!</p>

<p>(order date/time) - (shipping date):</p>

<p>Monday-Saturday before 2pm - same day
<br />Monday after 3pm - Tuesday
<br />Tuesday after 3pm - Wednesday
<br />Wednesday after 3pm - Thursday
<br />Thursday after 3pm - Friday
<br />Friday after 3pm - Saturday
<br />Saturday after 3pm - Monday
<br />Sunday - Monday</p>

<p>Now, for a few basic ground rules:</p>

<p>1. US only! (no international orders at this time)
<br />2. We require FE only! (finalize early)
<br />3. Release funds immediately! (please release funds immediately when order is confirmed!)
<br />4. Leave 5/5 rating! (if you have any reason to rate below a 5/5, please contact us first. We will do our best to remedy the issue. leaving less than a 5 before contacting us warrants a spot on our black-list!)
<br />5. Enjoy! (Happy Nods!)</p>

<p>That's it for now guys. Pretty simple! Just follow these simple rules, and we should all have a very good experience here!</p>

<p>keep in mind also that this is only a temporary measure to balance security risk for the vendor until auto-finalization and a working escrow system are back and working. Once everything is back up and running, we will be using either 50/50 escrow or full escrow!</p>

<p>Refund Policy:</p>

<p>If there is a problem with the order never arriving, we should already know about it and be taking care of it. However, if somehow we don't get the information that it has been seized, we will need proof from your end that it has in fact, been seized.</p>

<p>As far as our policy goes. We will be offering a 50% refund for any problems involving the product not showing up. This can be discussed and worked out with us upon receiving proof of seizure. This policy is subject to change without notice.</p>

<p>We will respond to any and all messages as quickly as we can! If at some point it gets out of hand, we will update this profile to let customers know we are backed up! So if at any point you are concerned about something, check back here for our updates!</p>

<p>-PCubeSensei</p>
