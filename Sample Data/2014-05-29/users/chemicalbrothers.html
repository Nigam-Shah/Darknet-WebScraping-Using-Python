<p>Hi everyone, please feel free to discuss my service/goods (no specific details about the packaging please) via the following link/s:</p>

<p>Main Database :</p>

<p>http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=22777.0</p>

<p>Newbie Version :</p>

<p>http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=22779.0  </p>

<p>Us Aussies need to stick together. We get scammed more than any other country in terms of nondeliveries.</p>

<p>POTENTIAL DEALERS - Need a consistent ongoing supply of high quality product at a price that for once makes sense? Message me for prices and let me know what your current weekly turnover is or what your goals are. All such arrangements get their own private listings and top priority along with my regular buyers.</p>

<p>TO ALL OTHER  VENDORS - PLEASE RESPECT THE CODE AND DONT ATTEMPT TO BELITTLE MY PRODUCT BY POSING AS BUYERS. I DONT DO IT TO ANYONE. NEVER DID AND NEVER WILL. PLEASE LEAVE THE MARKET UP TO THE BUYERS TO DECIDE WHO THEY WANT TO DEAL WITH.  VENDORS BUYING OFF OTHER VENDORS TO RUN THEIR PRODUCT INTO THE GROUND ISNT ON.</p>

<p>STEP BY STEP FOR ORDER: </p>

<p>Place your orders by 12:30pm, ill print off your addresses and click ship soon after. If within 4 days you dont receive your package, request your tracking off me and ill gladly give it to you :) Im on the level... im not here to scam anyone...I just want to be paid....and to pay those who I NEED to pay.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I have established myself as a trusted vendor and my feedback speaks for itself as to how far I would go for my customers but in turn, I expect that payment be finalised early just so I can continue paying my cooks/suppliers on time and wont be affected by late payments or bitcoin fluctuations or sites being down for a while.</p>

<p>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>></p>

<p>A LITTLE BACKGROUND :) </p>

<p>I have been selling my wares on the darknet for over a year now, and while I admit im not perfect and can make a mistake but im not a scammer and will work with each and every single one of my customers to make sure they are in the end reasonably satisfied :) I say reasonably because its up to my discretion how I handle my business :) I hope you can respect that. Now, back to my history. I am an ex Aussie SR v1.0 Vendor and BMR/UTOPIA refugee by the same name! (My PGP is the same). Was also on SMP and got royally scammed. When SR v1.0 went down, I was voted in the top 15% of sellers, with no negative feedback at all. I was also the number 1 speed seller on SR when SR went down, and the top seller of speed in Australia on Sheep Marketplace... lost alot in that scam..  I was also the number one speed seller on SR when SR went down and the top Aussie seller of purely speed only on BMR. </p>

<p>As of 18/04/2014 - My main goods of both speed and MDMA are currently the best sellers on SR 2 :) and I am both honored and proud of this and thankful to all my customers for their support and loyalty (even through my growing pains).</p>

<p>Please check my feedback on here :) Ive already had sales, so order and see :)</p>

<p>I was and STILL AM providing the Aussie community with quality chunky chipped off speed straight from the ounce rock (NO CUTTER/FILLER ADDED) and to my customers doorstep within (in most cases) 24-72 hours. </p>

<p>You will receive mostly chunky pseudo based speed rocks with minimal powder with your orders of my speed. From time to time, I also stock imported high grade MDMA, imported cocaine which i always get from Peru and (s) isomer ketamine (hcl crystals) from time to time. Im also now stocking high grade ice/meth :) Have a look!</p>

<p>MESSAGING ME</p>

<p>I am introducing a new system to help me answer the most urgent messages first. Please use one of the following in your subject title when contacting me:</p>

<p>1. EXISTING ORDER - Please use this in your subject line to me so I can quickly get back to you with further info. Chasing up existing orders and being in contact with customers waiting for their product is my number one priority. I only ask that you please look at my accounts page for regular updates (so I dont have to waste time answering questions that I already addressed) and if my global announcements do not answer your questions then please contact me with your questions/issues. </p>

<p>2. CUSTOM ORDER - Please use this when you are enquiring about custom sized lot orders.</p>

<p>3. GENERAL QUESTION - Use this when you want to enquire about current batches, dosages or any other miscellanous questions.</p>

<p>In regards to all my messages I aim to answer them within 24 hours. Existing orders I will answer ASAP. Please understand I get hit with as many as 50+ messages a day now on average so this new way of messaging me will ensure I get onto the most time critical messages first.</p>

<p>PACKAGING</p>

<p>I pride myself on my quick turnaround and stealth of my packaging. I vacuum and myler seal every order under the strictest anti cross contamination conditions and my operation complies (if tested by a government lab) with high grade sterilization techniques that would conform to the ISO 11737 series.</p>

<p>All my orders are for DOMESTIC AUSTRALIA ONLY and I VAC/MYLER SEAL ALL MY ORDERS! Nothing comes from overseas. This is strictly an Australian domestic operation.</p>

<p>PAYMENT</p>

<p>Payment on SR 2 is automatic. Dont stress that you cant finalise, it auto finalises one I confirm it :)</p>

<p>SHIPMENT</p>

<p>All my products are shipped domestically by express post around Australia only and are vac/myler sealed prior to sending. You will NOT need to sign for your package. If you live on the other side of the country to me or if you live outside the express post zone, you will most likely receive your package 2-4 days after ordering as well if you live in WA my turn around will be 2-4 days. I try to get all my orders for the day but please if you absolutely need it asap, pay the extra cost and save yourself the anxiety or otherwise please order well in advance. </p>

<p>IF SR v2.0 ever goes down, immediately speaking you can contact me on Agora. I will be designing a back up way of dealing with me that is both easy to use and secure.but it wont become active while this awesome site is up. It is just my contingency plan. </p>

<p>Cheers!
<br />-CB</p>
