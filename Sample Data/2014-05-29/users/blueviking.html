  <p>***Previous Postal Holiday***</p>

<p>Please keep in mind young Norse explorers that this past Monday (5/26) was a postal holiday. That means an extended weekend without mail, so please do not fret if it feels like your order is taking longer.</p>

<p>Let summer commence and praise Odin that quality LSD flows like wine.</p>

<p>*Silk Road Customers*</p>

<p>Due to the large volume of new user activity on Silk Road, we have decided that we will be slowly migrating our operations over to Agora and other markets. The reason behind this is because Silk Road has zero buyer accountability or purchasing statistics. We would prefer our customers to have a simple grasp on security and how the marketplaces work. There are too many parasites inhabiting what was once a great marketplace. We have found that screening potential customers is absolutely necessary to avoid the risk that uneducated buyers pose.</p>

<p>If you are a current customer of ours or planning a future purchase, I suggest signing up for an Agora account if you do not have one already. We will eventually offer escrow to buyers that have a strong purchasing history. We are also looking at moving to a storefront with other reputable vendors.</p>

<p>When Silk Road decides to finally make changes to it's infrastructure, we will more than happily return.</p>

<p>We are not in any way closing off ordering to new customers and are not leaving Silk Road immediately. </p>

<p>As long as we have listings up, you are more than welcomed to order.</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />A Few Changes To Shipping/Processing (Effective 5/18/14)</p>

<p>We are making a few changes to how we process and ship orders. Because of the amount of customers we serve on a daily basis, we felt it necessary to make these changes to provide a better and more secure service for customer and vendor. All of these changes were made so that we wouldn't have to raise prices or put a limit on daily ordering. If you are a regular customer of ours, none of these modifications will effect you. We will be modifying our vendor profile, but will be leaving this notice up so that existing customers can note the changes.</p>

<p>1) Our international shipping option has been changed to include only the following locations: Canada, United Kingdom, Most of Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand</p>

<p>Any order made to a country not listed above will be automatically cancelled.</p>

<p>2) We will be shipping Monday-Friday only. This will allow us to focus more time on answering questions and ensuring all customers are taken care. Less stress all around.</p>

<p>3) Our cutoff time for next day shipping will be 10pmPST/12amCST/1amEST. For example, if you place an order at 10pmPST on Wednesday, your order will ship on Thursday. If you place an order at 3amPST on Thursday, your order will ship Friday. Alternatively, all orders shipped after the cutoff time for Friday shipping will ship the following Monday. </p>

<p>4) We will only be offering one shipping option for domestic deliveries, First Class Super Stealth UNTRACKED. After experimenting with tracking for a month, we have found that it is much more unreliable and troublesome given the amount of orders we ship daily. Tracking methods take away from the overall stealth of the package and makes the order subject to more scrutiny. We've also found that untracked packages arrive quicker and have less overall issues with USPS screwing up the routing. </p>

<p>90% of current orders are placed using the UNTRACKED option and up until last month, we had shipped our orders untracked with virtually no issues. Our delivery success is on par or even better than non illicit mail and is also dependent on the shipping info we are given by the customer. This is why it is imperative that you triple check your information and to use an address with proven successful deliveries.</p>

<p>If you are uncomfortable with having an untracked order, PLEASE DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER.</p>

<p>We do however plan on implementing Priority shipping at a premium price. Priority shipping will still be mandatory on vials, but will be an option on all listings with 50 blotters or more.</p>

<p>It's understandable that some may not like these changes, but they are necessary for our growth. Our long time customers should have no issue with these changes. Thank you everyone for continuing to put trust into our shop. We promise that your trust will be reciprocated. 
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>

<p>Current News:</p>

<p>5/12 - The 150ug House White blotters are back! Listings will be up tonight after we get some time, and we have plenty to go around. Thank you to all for making this particular dosage/crystal such a success. </p>

<p>5/9 - We are going to have a massive sale starting this weekend on our House White liquid. $100 off a 100x vial and $50 off a 50x vial. One week only or until they are all gone.</p>

<p>We'll also be taking a rest this weekend. We are only human, so PM answering will be slower than normal while we relax. Happy Friday everyone!</p>

<p>5/8 - Both the 125ug Czech and the 180ug House are out of stock at the moment. Silk Road's shopping cart glitch allows listings that have zero stock to still be purchased. If your order is cancelled, it is because there is no stock.</p>

<p>5/7 - 150ug House White should be in stock within the next two weeks. We ensured that this time around they will not run out due to demand. </p>

<p>4/29 - Our new 100ug and 180ug House Brand Blotters are now ready. These blotters were only made possible because of our loyal customers. Each design was voted on by members of the community. Both prints are double sided. A 25+ tab purchase will net you the full artwork of each print. These prints are very beautiful, and have a special BlueViking design on the back. The art was made with the consumer in mind allowing each tab to have a bit of art on it.</p>

<p>4/27 - Wam Bam Thank You Ma'am! House White liquid is up. Be one of the first to try this beautiful substance.</p>

<p>4/27 - House White liquid listings will be up sometime today. Get ready for some super clean liquid ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>4/25 - 140ug Swiss Bicycle Day prints are gone. All orders will
<br />be filled with the Rama print. (Same dosage and purity)</p>

<p>4/22 - Stealth has been changed again. If you've ordered from us before, you'll need to look out for something different in the mail.</p>

<p>4/16 - Liquid Viking Tears sold out very fast. The good news is that the House Brand (High White Uber Crystal) will be available once the sale ends. Keep an eye here for an update.</p>

<p>4/12 - Back annd ready to go! Bicycle day sale will start now and continue until the 19th.</p>

<p>AL LAD will be on the menu shortly as well as a liquid version of our House White crystal.</p>

<p>================
<br />BEFORE YOU PM ME
<br />================
<br />All PM's are answered within 24 hours, usually less.
<br />I get a lot of PM's that are easily answered in my vendor
<br />profile, but some people do not take the time to read it.
<br />The more time I take answering PM's that are unnecessary, 
<br />the less time I have for customers that need help. Here is a 
<br />quick list so that you may save yourself some time. If you 
<br />still PM me with something that is answered below, 
<br />I will not answer you.</p>

<p>***DO NOT ASK ME***</p>

<p>-For a tracking number OR to see where your order is, especially if it is not late. Tracking is kept by us for security purposes and is only used to confirm delivery or in case of a dispute.</p>

<p>-To message you when your order ships. You can check the status of it anytime on your orders page. I also state my turnaround times below</p>

<p>-For me to customize stealth for you</p>

<p>-For Express Shipping</p>

<p>-For a tracking number (this is for our records only)</p>

<p>-For a free sample</p>

<p>-For me to check your address. Be responsible and triple
<br />check your address before ordering. My shippers will PM you
<br />if they have any issues during processing.</p>

<p>-To use Paypal or any other currency.</p>

<p>-To give you a discount because you don't have enough money</p>

<p>-What my stealth looks like</p>

<p>-How to use PGP or how to get Bitcoin. There is plenty of 
<br />info out there and Google is your friend.</p>

<p>============
<br />A Little About Us
<br />============</p>

<p>We have been Silk Road vendors for over two years. We are a Star rated LSD vendor by the LSD Avenger's on the old SR forums and the current TMG forums. We are listed as a Phenomenal Vendor on the new L-Team thread in the forums.  We currently sell on Silk Road, Agora, and The Majestic Garden. We have also sold on BMR and Sheep (bleh)</p>

<p>We believe that it is a human right to have freedom over your own consciousness. No one can tell you or force you to think. Until our draconian government changes, we will continue to sell mind altering substances. The stigma of LSD to the average non psychedelic user is silly, and we need to educate society on what a powerful tool LSD really is, to the mind and spirit.</p>

<p>We are here to provide you with high quality psychedelics. Anyone can provide a product, but we promise to have it to you quickly and safely. Not only that, our products are of the highest quality and very fairly priced. Give us a try, we guarantee you'll love the experience. Feel like shooting the shit? Shoot us a PM anytime. We love talking to our customers. But please realize that we average 100 PM's a day or more, so  allow us at least 24 hours to respond.</p>

<p>==================
<br />Our LSD
<br />==================</p>

<p>Although we have a friendly demeanor, we are completely serious when it comes to choosing our product and who we deal with. The people we work with are veterans in the industry and never settle for anything less than absolute high grade Lucy. These amazing people are literally the best of the best, and are pure professionals with a very vast knowledge of LSD.  </p>

<p>Our operations are very different from your average street dealer . We pride ourselves on the education of the products we sell and offering a unique selection, always changing our line to ensure everyone gets to experience a variety of crystal. We specialize in LSD specifically, but have been known to dabble in other psychs.</p>

<p>We stand behind our product and take pride in it. You will never see a listing that is overestimated in terms of microgram dosing. If anything, it will be slightly underestimated. We also try to keep the cost of our product low so that everyone that wants to partake in this beautiful molecule can do so. Just remember that even the professionals that produce this beautiful molecule know that the laying process is not perfect, but they come as close as you can get.</p>

<p>If you're looking for the real deal, please give us a try. If you're a first time user, please make sure to ask us what is right for you. We'd prefer that your first experience is one to remember, and getting low quality LSD is not something you want.</p>

<p>==========
<br />Ordering (A Must Read, Especially for New Members)
<br />==========
<br />- Please make sure you have educated yourself on using PGP. It really ensures safety for both of us. Encrypting your address wrong will delay your order. Practice using your own key or fake keys that you have made. Please do not ask me to check and see if your address can be decrypted. If it is wrong, my shipper will PM you.</p>

<p>- When you order, I cannot stress this enough, USE A REAL NAME AND ADDRESS. Or at least a proven address that has successful deliveries. Too many people do not receive their order because of this. I am not responsible for orders that get misdirected or "no delivery."</p>

<p>-Triple check your address before ordering. Second guessing yourself after you make an order does nothing but make you doubt yourself. PM's to me regarding address changes are highly unlikely to get corrected because of our quick turnaround times. Make sure it's right the first time and you'll have no issues receiving your product  </p>

<p>-To help combat typing in an address that is wrong or missing something vita, keep a .txt file with your address in it so that way you can use it every time with confidence.</p>

<p>-The Combined Shipping option is to only be used once at least one listing has had shipping paid for. Example: You want 3 hits of LSD and 1 gram of 2C-B. Select the First Class shipping option on one of the two listings, and the Combined Shipping on the other. That way you only pay for shipping once and all items will ship together.</p>

<p>-No Privnote or TorSMS</p>

<p>-Please use PGP (Side Note: My shippers have been noticing a lot of addresses that are just sitting on top of someone's PGP key. This is not how you encrypt an address. No part of your shipping info should be legible. All PGP encryption messages start with BEGIN PGP MESSAGE and end with END PGP MESSAGE.</p>

<p>-Please do not ask for samples, all of my listings are pre-packaged</p>

<p>Address Formatting:</p>

<p>US Customers (Use all caps if possible. Postal machines read the letters better)</p>

<p>Ellis Dee
<br />123 Lucy Lane Apt 1
<br />This line may be used too
<br />Lysergic, CA 54545</p>

<p>International Customers:</p>

<p>Please format your address according the US Postal service formatting regulations.</p>

<p>We cannot remember the format for hundreds of countries, so please format correctly or your order will be cancelled. Improperly formatted addresses are the cost of most delays, mis routes, or non deliveries. Our shipping team does not have time to format your address for you.</p>

<p>==========
<br />Shipping
<br />==========</p>

<p>-Our cutoff time for next day shipping will be 10pmPST/12amCST/1amEST. For example, if you place an order at 10pmPST on Wednesday, your order will ship on Thursday. If you place an order at 3amPST on Thursday, your order will ship Friday. Alternatively, all orders shipped after the cutoff time for Friday shipping will ship the following Monday. </p>

<p>-We ship Monday-Friday only.</p>

<p>-Shipping averages are 2-5  business days for domestic customers. Business days are Mon-Fri. Please remember that First Class mail does NOT move on Saturdays in some facilities now that USPS has cut back their services. </p>

<p>-If your product has been marked shipped, it has left my hands and is up to the postal gods to find it's way to you. I have an excellent record of delivering goods, on par if not better than USPS's lost mail rate. If your order hasn't arrived within this time, please wait at least 7 business before contacting me.</p>

<p>-Please Note: The postal service is very fickle. I have seen Priority packages take 3 weeks. I have seen First Class take anywhere from 1-12 days. Please be patient. We have no control over the mail and delays happen every now and then.</p>

<p>IF YOUR PACKAGE HAS NOT COME IN THE AVERAGE ALLOTED TIME:</p>

<p>My shipper is very good, he has been doing this and only this for a long time. Our stealth will make it to any country without being stopped. If your package does not arrive, it is due to one or more of the following things:</p>

<p>-You used a fake name (I've been getting a lot of orders that are missing names. For the love of Zeus, please include a name.)
<br />-You used a fake address
<br />-You made an error whilst typing your address
<br />-You threw it away
<br />-Your parent, husband, wife, roommate, boyfriend, girlfriend, dog, threw it away
<br />-It is delayed by weather
<br />-It has been misrouted but will eventually make it to you if none of the above apply
<br />-The plane carrying it has crashed and the survivors are using it as kindling. 
<br />-It has been lost (USPS reports between 3-5% of parcels are lost or delivered incorrectly)</p>

<p>Estimated International Delivery Times </p>

<p>Canada - 4- 10 Business days (average is about 5-7)</p>

<p>UK - 4-7 Business days (average is 4-5)</p>

<p>Scandinavia - 7-14 Business days</p>

<p>Australia - 7-14 Business days (average is 10 or less)</p>

<p>*Please remember that we literally have no control over how the mail flows. If an order is late we understand that it can be frustrating. We ship out every day like clockwork, so a late delivery frustrates us as well. </p>

<p>==========
<br />Refunds
<br />==========</p>

<p>Priority Tracked Packages- If you order shows Delivered, Out for Delivery, Returned to Sender, or Undeliverable as Addressed, you will not be eligible for a refund. If the postal service has lost it or misrouted it, we will offer a 50% reship.</p>

<p>We have a strict refund policy, but have always worked with customers in the past that claimed they haven't received their product. Because Silk Road's lack of Buyer Stats, we cannot offer refunds or reship. If you are a reputable and honest buyer, please contact Silk Road or post in the forums and lobby for Buyer Stats. </p>

<p>If you prefer the safety of a reship policy, please purchase from us on Agora and build your buyers stats up.</p>

<p>You take full responsibility for your order. There will be absolutely no refunds, reships, or discounted orders. We have used this method for two years with virtually no issues.</p>

<p>Extortion and scamming attempts will not be tolerated and will result in a Vendor Blacklist.</p>

<p>==========
<br />Feedback and Helpful Forum Threads
<br />==========
<br />If you have a problem and plan on leaving less than a 5/5 for feedback, please contact us. We want to make sure our customers experience is silky smooth. But a fair warning, we do not tolerate scammers or extortionists. </p>

<p>I always welcome customers to leave feedback and trip reports in my thread. I'll having a changing assortment of LSD, so it will be interesting to see how people like the different dosages/crystal.</p>

<p>==================
<br />LSD Interference 
<br />==================</p>

<p>Some people may experience a dull trip, or not even trip at all. It is completely possible that you do not react to LSD, it's very rare but it happens. If you think your trip was dull, don't blame it on the LSD as there are a lot of factors that could interfere with your trip. Do not take or have any of the following in your system:</p>

<p>-Benzodiazpines (Xanax, Klonopin, Alprazolam) 
<br />-SSRI's
<br />-Anti-Depressants
<br />-Opiates (this is a big one)
<br />-Ephedra</p>

<p>Also, you need to wait AT LEAST one week between using psychedelics. This will make your trip more enjoyable and intense.</p>
