<p>---------------Things that may effect your orders --------------------</p>

<p>.
<br />5/18  The BTH issue is solved and I will have it for the foreseeable future.
<br />I must apologize for the slow work on delivering your orders.  Im having to do much of it myself because my help is/was not competent.  
<br />I suspect that they may have tampered with the BTH by cutting it with powdered sugar.  That is the main reason everything is slow.  
<br />It so hard to find honest, honorable people these days.
<br />I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR ORDERS ARE ALL BEING SENT OUT.  They may be late by 3 or four days, but they will be sent.
<br />--
<br />5/8  I have run into a problem acquiring BTH.  I do not know if it is temporary or if it will go on for some time.
<br />After a year and a half of setting up fungus growers to grow for me I FINALLY found one that I can be proud of!
<br />Fungus is plentiful and quite good.  No more stringy, dark, hollow, small capped shrooms.  Just the good stuff for a while at least.  I unstealthed the 1/2 pound listing. 
<br />5/3  I am caught up on your orders and going to answer messages in the next 24 hours.
<br />It was hot here for a while.  
<br />I was laying very low.  
<br />DHS just built one of the largest HQs they have here.  There are so f-n many cops here already... it is sick.
<br />Oh well.  
<br />I am back on track.  I finally have a new grower set up and producing. (last 2 failed me)  Fungus should be more readily available... AND BETTER if you got some of the stringy dark shrooms I am sorry.  That crack smoker is no longer growing for me. </p>

<p>4/29  I am catching up on my orders and have someone that is helping me catch up on everything else.  As far as working goes, I have never worked so hard in my life.  The pay is good but I am running around 24/7 to get it all done.  
<br />I may not be having Black very soon.
<br />I may even have to stop with the 'Go Fast' because the supplier for those is taking a break.  
<br />I will be able to get new suppliers but I am not sure on the quality.</p>

<p>4/26  I am trying to catch up.  I know there have been some major delays in the past 3 weeks.  ALL PACKAGES ARE BEING SENT!
<br />They may be late but they are getting sent.</p>

<p>3/7  I have fallen behind on messages and a day behind on orders.
<br />It will take 48 hours to send.
<br />2/28  I am behind on my messages again.  Its hard to run a three ring circus as a one-man-show without letting something slide.
<br />I will stop writing here and go to messages ASAP to knowck out a few of them at least.
<br />2/10  I am off vacation mode but will not start working until tuesday.
<br />I hope you all had a good weekend.
<br />2/3  I will be entering VACATION MODE in a day or two.  I should be exiting vacation mode a few days later.
<br />1/31  I have T.Leary's Oaxacan Strain again.
<br />Still waiting on the DMT.
<br />1/30  Thank you for your orders!!  I am very proud of my staff and honored that so many of you trust me to send you a quality product in a safe manner.
<br />I am falling behind on my emails but keeping up with the orders.
<br />  
<br />1/21  All orders placed from the evening of the 16th until the 21st will be mailed on the 21st.  I don't want your orders sitting in a USPS sort facility over the long weekend.
<br />Smells permeate over time.  This is why a dog can smell weed and USD in sealed PVC pipes inside a gas tank.
<br />A couple great videos to watch are "Never Get Busted" and "Never Get Raided".  They are done by a former cop.
<br /> 
<br />1/12  I have been having a hard time signing on to SR the last 4 or 5 days.  I have all your orders and intend to send them out on Sunday.  A PO is open for a while here on Sunday.
<br />I hope the orders will arrive on Tuesday but I think it will be Wednesday.</p>

<p>12/31  I started to put my listings up today.  there should be a contest for who lost the most BTC from the closing of all the marketplaces!</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />`
<br />******* NEW SHIPPING POLICY FOR ALL ORDERS. *******
<br />.
<br />Since the last SR "robbery" cleaned me out of so much escrow (35000USD) I feel the best place for the BTCs you put up for orders is not on the website.
<br />I therefore click shipped as soon as I have your information and the product to cover the order.
<br />Clicking "shipped" DOES NOT mean your order has been shipped.
<br />It means that even if SR goes down your order will be shipped.
<br />From the time I mark an order as shipped it can be as long as 72 hours before it actually gets to the post office.
<br />You can rest assured that it will be shipped if I have collected the BTCs by marking the order as shipped.
<br />EVEN IF SR GOES DOWN I WILL SEND ALL ORDERS MARKED AS SHIPPED.
<br />.
<br />******** ABOUT DELAYS AND THE DAUNTING TASK THAT IS VENDING ON SR *******
<br />.
<br />I know many vendors on SR are shady and not to be trusted.  
<br />I hope that eventually trusted and honorable vendors will push them out.
<br />I promise that I do my best to do each customer right.  I mess up sometimes due to the enormity of the tasks I have to attend to.
<br />I have had to let most of my help go due to a lack of motivation or trustworthiness.  
<br />Please forgive any delays in shipping or answering messages.
<br />I prioritize orders first.
<br />Then update listings.
<br />Then the dance of safely making BTCs useable IRL.
<br />Then answering my messages.
<br />and finally sleep.</p>

<p>`
<br />___________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>>>>> IF YOUR ORDER IS CANCELED &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I have taken extra precautions in checking on shipping address.  If an address comes up as strange I will cancel your orders.</p>

<p>I have been using a Private Investigator to look at many of the addresses I get.  The PI has no clue what you order, or the name used.  
<br />No worries the PI is a friend of mine and has been my entire life.  I trust NO ONE as much as my PI.  
<br />`
<br />`
<br />___________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>>>>> Stealth Listings and Bulk Orders &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>*********************************************************************************
<br />If you would like to order larger amounts than I have listed you may message me the request.  
<br />I may have it already listed in stealth.
<br />*********************************************************************************
<br />`
<br />`
<br />___________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>>>>> Stealth Shipping and International orders &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br />.
<br />I take Sundays off.  Orders made on Saturday after 6:00 PM UTC will not be sent until Monday at the earliest.</p>

<p>*** AUSSIES ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK! ***
<br />     FE REQUIRED FOR AUSTRALIA AND NZ</p>

<p>That being said, I have greatly improved my stealth.  I have had several people discard their orders not knowing that the contents were hidden within.
<br />If you know how I use to send stuff then you know I was creative.  I look at the old way as dangerous and foolish relative to my new method.</p>

<p>For years my number one concern was finding the best products I could.  
<br />Now that I have a chance to share the product of those years of hunting, I have a new number one concern.</p>

<p>Customer Safety!</p>

<p>My shipping costs are high because freedom is priceless.  I take your safety very seriously.
<br />If you get in trouble then I lose a customer.
<br />`
<br />`</p>

<p>-------------------------- Fungus -----------------------
<br />Many years ago I was told that this strain was taken from the files of the university in Berkeley.  That it was a strain that was collected by Timothy Leary himself.
<br />The story was that he found this strain just outside a ruined temple or pyramid outside of Oaxaca, Mexico.  That Maria Sabina told him where to go to find it and had her house burned down and family destroyed for her efforts.
<br />That is the story.  I like to believe it is true.
<br />Because of the texture of the high I feel it very well could be true.
<br />The strange things that happen while high on these shrooms can be nonsensical to a sober mind.
<br />I have noted that taking 3 grams by myself can give me the same buzz as taking 1.5 grams with 4-5 others that are on the same amount.  Once I split 11 grams between 8 Deadheads fresh off of tour and 3 of us puked (me included).  A fourth spun to Terrapin Station in a 100+ degree house and collapsed into a puddle of his own sweat when the album finished.  I mean “puddle” literally.  
<br />I have been known to “steal” peoples buzz when they are too high.  I don’t tend to feel higher for very long but they sober up fairly quickly.
<br />If the story is believed, Timothy Leary’s life was changed by these  shrooms.   His path of clinical psychologist was forever altered and he became an icon for the psychedelic lifestyle that is all but gone today.  He believed in this high.  He thought it was the answer to many of the worlds problems.
<br />They changed his life and I hope they can do the same for others.   
<br />.
<br />.
<br />----------------------------------- DMT -------------------------------------
<br />In DMT the Spirit Molecule Staussman approached the experiences his volunteers have on DMT as reality, not some hallucination.  He states that a state of mind that is induced by chemicals is no less valid than the state of being that we consider “normal consciousness”.  After all, our consciousness could very well be a chemically induced state in and of itself.  He believes, that DMT produced in the pineal gland, is that chemical.
<br />Two enzymatic steps away from melatonin DMT is able to be made by most living animals.  The enzymes that would be needed to change the melatonin into DMT are present and local to the melatonin.
<br />I have read that when LSD was given to spiritualists in the far east they generally said it was not as good as meditation.  Staussman is a Buddhist.  I think he believes that DMT can be released in very deep meditative states.   That he was looking for that link in his DMT trials. 
<br />If DMT is ‘hyper-consciousness’ but the same reality as normal consciousness then much can be learned from the experience.  
<br />No need to say much about the DMT here
<br />It is Freeze Precipitated 
<br />It is in its freebase form (smokeable)
<br />IMHO
<br />You have never been as high as DMT can make you.  It is the ultimate experience of what it is to live.    
<br />.
<br />.
<br />--------------------------- Go Fast --------------------------
<br />The Go Fast is very high quality. the only cut in it (if any) was put there by the manufacturer.  
<br />I was it all and will occasionally recrystallize it if it is not up to snuff.
<br />It is usually very chunky.  If you get some that is not chunky... it was before it was broke up.  So it will be consistent throughout the bag.
<br />If I have to send you a little from two different batches I package them separately. (same box but not mixed)
<br />.
<br />-------------------------------- Black Tar ------------------------------------
<br />The BTH is usually in a powder when I get it because that is how it must be to cut it. 
<br />It would get cut before it hits the street.
<br />I only know IV users so it is that quality.  
<br />
