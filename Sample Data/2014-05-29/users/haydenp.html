  <p>Update 5/29 1:20 AM
<br />We were just able to log on, after not be able to log onto the site all evening. As a result, all pending orders will be sent out first thing friday morning. If your order to be cancelle please send me a message with the word "CANCEL" in the subject line.</p>

<p>Update  #2 (continued 5/29 1:20 AM)
<br />We previously announced that we will be going on vacation "around the date of June 1st". We are extending our operating days for a couple more days so that we can finish up and help everyone get their ketamine for the summer, until we get back. We will be open June 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and our last day to order is on June 3rd and our last shipping day is Wednesday June 4th. We will be gone for at least 4 weeks and our estimated date of coming back is around the first week of July. Stay tuned for more info. During our vacation, we will log onto our account once or twice a week, to take care of any emergency questions and such. If you want to order, but want to stay in escrow, check us out on agora</p>

<p>We will be taking a vacation starting on or around the dates of June 1 thru July 15. More info will be coming in the next few days.</p>

<p>I thought I said this pretty clearly in my shipping policy but I am going to reiterate it:
<br />If you order to a PO BOX, you MUST use the name that the PO BOX was rented under. Otherwise, there is a chance that the package will get returned to sender (sometimes you may get lucky, it depends on the mail sorter that day). If you order to a PO Box, and the tracking says "returned to sender because it could not be delivered as addressed.", or some other similiar that indicates you used a fake name on the shipping address, you are elgible for ZERO refund</p>

<p>**********************DO NOT choose express shipping option without contacting me first! This goes for everybody, whether you have ordered express in the past, or not. Express is for emergencies only. I have talked to other vendors, and apparently 95% of shipping problems occur with express overnite parcels. I am having my first potential mising package, and it is an overnite package. Priority is much safer, for both the vendor and the consumer, because priority uses printed labels, but express MUST use handwritten (for the carbon paper on the outside). Another reason is because it is harder for me to get ahold of lots of express stamps in my area, as opposed to priority stamps.******************************************</p>

<p>update 4/7</p>

<p>We got some new shatter in and it is a bit darker than the picture but it still has the same or similiar potency and texture.</p>

<p>update 3/24
<br />We have ketamine in stock, but in very limited quantities. Due to the global ketamine shortages, we have to source our ketamine from a more expensive supplier. The ketamine is tested and uncut. Due to this we were forced to temporarily raise our prices incrementally.  Hopefully this shortage will end soon so that we can lower our prices back to where they used to be.</p>

<p>The major ketamine seizures that have occured overseas recently, are starting to affect my suppliers. Instead of buying our ketamine from one source, my suppliers have been forced to purchase from several sources and those sources aren't as cheap as the original source. As a result, I will no longer be selling ketamine in quantities of more than 28 grams until further notice. Also, prices will go up 10% until further notice. I apologize in advance for any inconvience this may be causing/have caused you. 
<br />From now on the ketamine that I have in stock is racemic.</p>

<p>Please dont ask me for your tracking if it hasn't been at least 72 hours since i marked it in transit. Its hard to answer back everybodys questions and messages when i have to sift thru hundreds of tracking requests a week that have only been in transit for a couple of HOURs. Thanks guys,
<br />â¥
<br />hayden</p>

<p>Due to he large volume of orders that we've been getting recently, we have a new cutoff time: The new cutoff time is 11:59pm the nite before. So if you order at 11:30pm, then your order will go out 9 hours later in the morning, However, if you order AFTER midnite then your order will go out the following day. Thank you for understanding</p>

<p>If your btc deposit is taking forever to get to your wallet, check out this thread: 
<br />http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=17371.0</p>

<p>Please do not ask me for your tracking number unless it has been 3 days since your order was marked in transit (2 days for express). 95% of packages are delivered within 3 days.</p>

<p>Most vendors do NOt give out tracking number. I try to send tracking numbers to my customers (as a favor) if they ask for it, but if you are rude, disrespectful or downright obnoxious your tracking request will be ignored.
<br />If you send me a a tracking number request, please send me your zip code, the estimated date that i marked it in transit and your PGP key so that i can send it back to you encrypted. Please allow me 12-16 hours for me to get you the tracking number from my shipper. </p>

<p>FAQ's:</p>

<p>1. Do you accept PayPal, etc?</p>

<p>No, the only payment method I accept is Bitcoin via Silk Road escrow.</p>

<p>You can anonymously convert fiat to BTC on localbitcoins.com, which has a secure escrow system in place</p>

<p>2.Do you require FE?</p>

<p>No, FE is never required!</p>

<p>3. Can I get the tracking number?</p>

<p>Tracking numbers are used in order to prevent scammers and in order to give refunds when a package gets lost. 
<br />95% of packages are delivered within 3 (business) days of being marked in transit. If your package still has not arrived after the 3rd day, send me your zip code and pgp key and i will forward the info to my shipper, who will then send me your tracking number.</p>

<p>4. I dont have enough for your $900 ketamine listing. Can you please send me X amount of bitcoins to my wallet?</p>

<p>No, this is not a charity. I am running a business here. I do not send out bitcoins to random strangers. If I gave out free bitcoins to all the bitcoin beggars who ask me for them, I would be out of business. I get dozens of these requests everyday, and most of these are just scammers who are looking for free bitcoins.
<br />If you are legitimately interested in making a purchase but are short $1, then message me and I will make a custom listing for ya. But if you are short $25 for a one gram listing, I will not be able to help you. Sorry.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Our main item will be ketamine. Very pure and very potent. I test each batch with the Mandelin test. Domestic USA only. Our goal is to sell the purest, most potent, and cheapest ketamine in the USA!</p>

<p>HaydenP Official Review Thread: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=4202.0</p>

<p>Here is a link to some deadmau5 :)
<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyPFVJdlxh0</p>

<p>Please use PGP when placing orders with us, it is for YOUR safety!
<br />And remember, NEVER FE!!!
<br />We never ask anybody to FE, ever. </p>

<p>About Us:
<br />As a service based company, itâs critical that we satisfy our customers. How do we do that? In all our interactions with our customers, we live out our core values Integrity, Respect, and Responsibility.
<br /> 
<br />We take the time to build meaningful relationships and team with our customers. We listen to them, analyze their requirements, and then work together to find value-added solutions that we can execute successfully.</p>

<p>If you had a great experience, please leave a positive review for me so i can build up a good rep, so that i can spread lots of ketamine out to all you awesome ppl!!
<br />ve never had a lost package! We believe in and stand by our stealth method. As long as you provide us with a valid name and address, your pack willl be delivered. Guaranteed! (Or your money back)
<br />**No refunds on letters packages that were sent with untracked (first class shipping). I only offer refunds on priority mail or express packages. </p>

<p>*PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE EXPRESS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE*</p>

<p>***Shipping***
<br />We have 2 options for shipping, priority shipping and Express overnite shipping. Both are tracked and both NEVER require signature. The priority will arrive 2-3 business days after you place the order. The cutoff time for express overnite is 9:00 am (on certain days it is a couple hours later at 11:30). If the order comes in before 9 am (EST) then the order will be sent out  same day at 10 am and you will receive the package the next morning.
<br />If the order is placed after 9 am (11:30 am on some days), then the order will be sent out at 10 am the next business day.
<br />WE DO NOT SHIP TO ALASKA OR HAWAII!! The reason for this is because since Alaska and Hawaii are located far distance from the other states, the only way to get drugs into these states are by airlines or the mail. As a result the mail to these states are much more scrutinized than the mail to the other 48 states. </p>

<p>PLEASE DO NOT USE A FAKE NAME!!! Especially for P.O. Boxes. If you use a fake name, and the package gets returned to sender  "because it could not be delivered as addressed." then you are elgible for ZERO refund. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Please feel free to PM us anytime and we will try our best to get back to you within 12 hours or less.</p>

<p>Please use PGP when placing orders with us. If Silk Road gets taken down by the Feds, and you used PGP, the feds will NOT be able to see the address that you sent us using PGP.
<br />If you need help learning how to use PGP, I will be happy to try to help you learn, just message me!
