  <p>NEWS____________________________________________________
<br />5/28
<br />just a heads up for everyone, so i'm getting low, the orders just keep coming and i keep trying to get my alprazolam way in advance but it doesn't seem to help lol, so im not gunna say how much i buy but i'm gunna try to start buying a months worth at a time, as of right now i should be getting more alp any day now and i still have pills left but i don't have it yet and there is a chance i could run out cause i keep getting alot of msgs about people wanting this and that</p>

<p>Also about pill quality, i'm sure some have noticed who used to buy when i first started that pill quality has improved alot, its to the point that im quite happy about it and i don't feel any one has room to complain however, i'm not happy till its perfect so its gunna be a 2-3 weeks i'm probably dropping like 5k to be able to make more pills faster and better quality hopefully the best quality on the road and all the dark web. So if ur happy now in a month ull be even happier thanks again for all the kind words much love see ya!</p>

<p>________________________________________________________
<br />*****methadone announcement ready msg me if u may be intererest don't expect a reply unless needed, i'm not up for negotiations, none of more orders are negotiable if u wanna negotiate goto snowdick2 and see how that good for ya******</p>

<p>Question for my customers or anyone looking at this profile being that im a reputable vendor i'm considering offering a new product, 10mg methadose methadone pills, they would sell for
<br />$50 for 5
<br />$90 for 10
<br />$160 for 20
<br />$280 for 40
<br />$480 for 80
<br />$800 for 160 maximum about that would be availible unless i get a better deal on them and buy more and it really takes off.</p>

<p>IF ANY ONE READING THIS IS INTERESTED FOR REAL MSG ME I WANNA SEE HOW MUCH DESIRE THERE IS BEFORE I DROP MAD MONEY ON THIS i mean not reply unless neccisary its kinda like a poll.</p>

<p>*****Memorial day msg****</p>

<p>Please have a safe memorial day weekend, don't fucking drive fucked up, don't mix ur drugs, don't fuckin kill ur self please. It may sound like a paradox coming from me but I'm very much aware i can't stop any body from using who doesn't want to stop, if  u can use responsibly more power too ya, Although i'm sure some of u don't and even if this msg helps 1 person that is enough for me. If u don't get stuff from me ull get it else where but just know that i care about u and i do put that time and care into making my product and just please be safe. People deserve the right to make there own choices, telling people no just makes them wanna do shit more so thank fully we have this place, u can choose and thats what matters, u are free to choose what u want, ur free to not have to go to some shady street dealer. Long live the road and long live all of u have a good weekend.</p>

<p>I know my profile is long but take to time to read it, it saves lives and is
<br />a requirement before ordering &_&!
<br />-----NOTICE ABOUT PGP AND MSGS-----
<br />hey guys not-quick annoucement about msgs, 
<br />I know that pgp is pain, Also privnote is not 100%, but better then nothing. Any ways just want to make u guys aware of the following:</p>

<p>1. Vendors can't read ur profile so we can't get ur public key.
<br />edit: i almost forgot plz plz plz, when u make a public key, use the same username u use on sr, don't make ur public key, "vagina farts" and ur sr name "robot dicks", they have absolutely nothing to do with each other... as far as i know, make both "robot dicks"</p>

<p>2. if ur gunna send clear text, u can go back and delete ur msgs however its nice to get a heads up that my msg was read so that i know to delete.</p>

<p>3. If i were using clear text i would be careful what i say, pretend ur talking on a phone and its tapped. don't say certain inciminating words,
<br />don't use ur real name, and don't describe exact details of packages, there is probably more u can do but thats just a few, if ur msging me 
<br />asking can u get me a bulk quantity, u don't have to say can u get me a certain amount of xbars, u can say can u get me 2500, ill know whats up :)
<br />(see how i skirt around saying actual words yet i still convey the msg its easy)</p>

<p>4. and finally i am pretty good with replying to msgs, i do my best at least, i'm only human, but please note that it helps to do the following
<br />keep all ur msgs in the same thread meaning don't create a new msg with a new title every time u gotta msg me it makes it easier to figure out things.
<br />also try to keep ur msgs short, i know at times i can be wordy but i try to cut down on that however, YOU have more time then i do to read msgs,
<br />so short and sweet is always the best policy. If ur msg starts getting long or is difficult to understand i usually space out and just reply
<br />to the best parts i can remember.</p>

<p>5. If and when this site is ever comprimised the feds will try to use msgs against u, so that is why it is very important to not incrimnate ur self
<br />and just pgp everything as it makes it almost impossible for them to decipher 1 msg, just imagine having to decipher the whole roads who has the time
<br />for that! That time could be better spent catching violent street dealers rather then some computer sandwich.</p>

<p>6. thanks for ur time we hope to be back very soon, all i can say is we will be back its just a matter of when thanks so much for the aweasome feed
<br />back i love u guys.</p>

<p>7. ohh yeah and most importantly, i have nothing against msgs, and if u wanna send a msg go ahead however, the % of people who just send me a pgped
<br />address(and name don't dont' forget the goddamn name or recipient)
<br /> and never msg me once is very high and they always get there goodies so u don't have to msg me saying " did u get my order" if it makes u
<br />feel better then do it, but know that i can't spend every waking hr on tor and that taking time to reply to msgs cuts into time to prep orders
<br />Thanks I fuckin love this community and all the good people i have met along the way!
<br />-----END NOTICE ABOUT PGP AND MSGS-----</p>

<p>@#$@#$@%#@$ REMINDER @#$#^%#%#%
<br />Good evening fellow netizens of the road that be o so silky.
<br />It has come to thy attention that some people have trouble getting there address right. I will state again as i have in the past. YOU are fully responsible for getting ur address right and sending it to me. I have sooooo many customers who have never once gotten it wrong. IT pains me greatly when someone doesn't recieve a package, HOWEVER thats why i track the bastards and what ever address u give me i copy and paste EVERYTHING. Too ensure ( not that gay drink for seniors) but to ensure that i get ur god damn address correct no questions asked. I have had this happen only 2 times that i know of unless people haven't brought it to my attention. I want u... to bring it my attention however keep in mind that its ur resonsiblity to get it CORRECT. so before u send that Name and address( alot of people forget the name, i will not send with out some kind of recipient its sketchy and  looks shady). So once again, i love all my customers be safe, but check them names and addresses cause i won't be held responsible for ur mistakes and it hurts my feelings when some doesn't get a package
<br />thx x
<br />ps we will be back next week i'm thinking tues day hopefully sooner but as soon as im back vacation mode off and listings up k stay safe!</p>

<p>4/30:
<br />hey guys wanted to thank everybody for the kind feedback, when i started this venture i always said honesty is the best policy, and it feels very good to established trust with so many good people. I had a person on agora claim that my bars tested at 2.52 mgs, i have no way of knowing if its true but i figured its worth a mention.</p>

<p>Look i'm not accusing any other vendors or pointings fingers but i have been told on more then one occasion that other some other vendors product tested at 1.3mgs and just plain didn't have the zing and potency of my product. I'm prowd of the fact that people are telling me this and it just goes to show u do the right thing and things will pay off!
<br />That being said please everybody who is using my product or addicted please be safe, i know i don't need to tell u but i'm gunna. Be safe, don't mix xanax with other substance as it can result in death, use responsibly, i'm  a big believer in people should have the right to choose what they wanna do but also some people are not capable of controlling themselves so please becareful Thanks so much.
<br />xanman!
<br />any one who says otherwise is a god damn liar thanks!</p>

<p>(NOTE FOR BULK BUYERS: Because fe is now required on all purchases(except 25, 50, 100 on agora), if you purchase 250 pills or more i will be including a tracking number as a little extra back up just so you feel a little more at ease for having to FE so much money however if you are a big buyer then you have dealt with me before and you know we don't play games so this ONLY for buyers who get 250 or greater pills in 1 order. NOT life time 1 order. anyone else sorry you just have to trust in out stellar reviews which i must say are stellar thanks so much for all the love repeat customers and new repeat customers.)(if i forget to send it don't be scared to pm me and i will send it over but there are very few who are eligible for this and i wouldn't be viewing it on your comp without a VPN or do it someone else computer u don't want any tracking numbers being tracked back your computer if something were to go down just a reminder)</p>

<p>EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN -updated 1-15-
<br />okay so in the fact that sr goes down and you need to contact me you can contact me at (xanman12345678@Safe-mail.net)
<br />HOWEVER!!!!!! Do not send me msgs there as i don't check it regularly or at all it is only for back up purposes, and #2 rule about back up plan
<br />if for some reason you do have to contact me you think im strict about pgp on here well you better damn side used pgp on every little fuckin letter you type to me on there understood! if not i will literally open your email, see that it is not pgp encrypted, then i will print your email out goto the bathroom and take a shit on it and then wipe the shit off(wear rubber gloves of course ) and then pass it thru a paper shreader and then burn the remains. So please please please don't contact me there unless sr is down cause i don't check it. one final thing some of you ask to do bussiness outside of sr and the answer is no i would prefer to stick to the sr escrow system, it proves that im no bullshiter and it is easier to do everything through here so all business goes through the road please. Thanks</p>

<p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PGP PLEASESSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -updated 1-15-
<br />FINAL IMPORTANT NOTE: AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW SR WILL BE OFFERING VENDORS THE ABILITY TO ONLY ACCEPT PURCHASES AND MSGS PGP ENCRYPTED. I WILL DEFINATLY BE TURNING IT ON FOR PURCHASES AND WILL
<br />PROBABLY BE TURNING IT ON FOR MSGS SO THAT MEANS TIME TO LEARN PGP AND LEARN IT WELL HERE IS A REALLY GOOD LINK TO MAKE IT AS EASY AND AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE.
<br />http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=11987.0
<br />when i say pgp i mean everything when you send me a msg first encrypt it to me using my public key! then include your public key(so i can send you encrypted msges back) Also if your name used to register your public key is different then you sr name it would really help to let me know that that name
<br />is cause as soon as i add you key i gotta play the guessing game as to what new key popped up and i hate playing that game so if your new make it easy on the world and create a public key that has the same name as your sr user name or include ur sr username in the fake email you provide to make it etc
<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Guidelines: ((some updates have been made:12/30))
<br />1. I am an honest guy, and i want nothing more but to be given a chance to prosper on here.
<br />2. Please try to use pgp for all orders and msgs, i will not require it cause alot of people just place orders unencrypted and i just gave up trying to enforce the rule, its for your safety. However if your gunna be msging back and forth with me i'm gunna need your public key and your gunna need to learn pgp cause every clear text msg i send i gotta go back delete every single one manually and its a pain in the ass and i have alot of catch up to play so just try to learn pgp but its not a requirement for ordering but i strongly suggest  you use it
<br />(updated 2-20)
<br />3. As of right now no tracking numbers will be provided. However I do have track the tracking numbers and know when you received your items so if you try and pull some shit or don't finalize, I will become a grouch
<br />thanks so please finalize on time and if your package says its been delivered then its been delivered no exceptions make sure you don't tell people that you order stuff in the mail cause your friends may try to steal it out of your mail boxes and such so i would suggest not telling any one you order stuff through the mail cause then they could try and steal your mail from you and then it says delivered on my end and you say you didn't get it will thats not my fault. So please be careful please :)
<br />4. Just note that i work a full time job and most of the time i am not available and won't be logged on from the hours of 1130pm est till around 5:30pmest the following day, now some times i get home early and if i do i try to get as many orders as i can shipped before the post office closes at 5 but i would always suggest places orders in advance, cause mon-friday there are large sections of time when i am not available.Perhaps some day i will make enough money that i can start another little business that allows me to be home all the time and that would make things even better but for now sorry thats the rules ya gotta deal with it :(
<br />5. In terms of shipping i offering USPS priority and priority express for right now, i don't want anything slower, I want you to receive your product fast and i wanna receive my money fast, lets just make it easy on each other, im extremely easy to get along with but will not tolerate shenanigans.
<br />6. As of right now SR requires FE because of the recent hack but once they get everything fixed i will never require fe but will always appreciate it and i might make orders that are FE but you get a slight discount but thats just a future idea. Also i might add on canada as another place to ship to, but for now its just usa so everyone else.
<br />7. Stealth is very important to me, So you can expect quality stealth, i maybe a new vendor, but i have been around as a buyer since sr1.0 and i know my way around things plus i have put im my share of research hours.
<br />8. Once again safety is no.1 Priority, for ME and YOU, Addresses should ALWAYS BE SENT with PGP. You can guarantee with me that your address will not be stored on any type of list, I just wanna do things the best I CAN.
<br />9. And Finally NO 10.Don't forget to leave your NAME and your address when placing a order you would be surprised how many orders get placed and people don't leave a name, i would expect a real name if you did your research then you would know why its smart to use your real name but any ways i need a name to ship to i'm not going to be making up names for you. I can only trust the name you send me but if you don't get your package cause you put a fake name then don't come crying to me for a refund.
<br />10. If you have any issues with your order please contact me before finalizing and leaving feed back and give me an chance to make it right but if you did your reading you would understand what your buying and you should no reason to be upset. If for some Reason you don't get your package, and i do have tracking so i will know, then you will be entitled to a refund or a reship which ever you prefer but this is only if you don't receive your package and if the tracking says delivered and you still don't got it your SHIT OUTTA LUCK don't tell your friends your ordering stuff in the mail or your so call "friends" might try to steal your mail before you get it. Then all the sudden your up shits creek without a paddle
<br />***NEW***11. For those of you that don't finalize on time  be advised that i probably won't be doing business with you any more, plz note i don't give out tracking but i have the numbers and if i choose to check i know if and when your package arrived. Also you could run the risk of getting placed on the vendor black list on the vendor round table.</p>

<p>Product Info:
<br />These are Pfizer Xanax 2mg replicas, They contain more alprazolam then the actual pfizer xanax roughly around 2.5mgs/ea pill. All of the ingredients used to make these are the same stuff used in the pfizer brand. there are a few bullshit chemicals left out that are unnessasary like i think the real ones contain some kind of laxative or something. However these Contain the same fillers used by pfizer. These is no baking soda or fucking flour in these, they contain legit pill making shit that would be used in a professional plant.</p>

<p>ALSO MOST IMPORTANT the alprazolam is real. The person i recieve it from has had it lab tested. Feel free to test them yourself, they don't contain any other kind of benzo its just alprazolam. Also its quality alprazolam not some bullshit shipped over from india. This is the legit shit coming right from the factory and you won't be disappointed. Also i want you to be aware that the mold used to make them is not 100% identical as the one that pfizer uses, its difficult to obtain because the molds are always somebodys attempt to recreate pfizers, some are better then others. Another thing to note These bad boys break like a real xanax should into 4 pieces, They are not rock hard, and a real xanax should  be hard but not soo hard that your straining to break it. I have experience pressing and i know what im doing, some other vendors will straight out lie and say they got the real thing or they don't have experience pressing and make a shitty product, this is how we are able to create a quality product at a fair price and hope to improve on that in the future, Please take a look at the image real closely so you know what you are getting.</p>

<p>I understand some people buy these for them selves but others buy them for resale purposes, and it is important to make it look as close to exact as possible. size wise they are 15mm long by 4mm wide which is what a real pfizer xanax is they are almost identical in thickness. Once again feel free to dl the image and zoom in on it so you can get a good close look at what you are buying ok. </p>

<p>READ MY PROFILE before making purchases im an honest guy, not here to rip anyone off i just trying to make a buck and provide people a chance to buy bulk and make $$$$$, these babys sell for $5-$10 each depending on where you are from. so if you paying $1-$2 a pill doo the math it not hard to see the profit potential. BUT READ MY PROFILE ON RULES OF PURCHASE.</p>
