<br />Happy Monday you lot!</p>

<p>19-05
<br />If you have sent me a message and i have not responded to you yet, please resend your message and i will get back to you ASAP. I may have overlooked a couple messages last week.</p>

<p>17-05
<br />Shipping has continued, first orders are being sent out today!</p>

<p>13-05
<br />We are restructuring the business, we wil be unable to ship this week.. People who had ordered today will receive 50 percent extra this week! But shipping will take place on monday.</p>

<p>08-05
<br />Ok i have to stop shipping to Australia for the moment. I have to deal with too many people who can't read terms and call me a selective scammer. If you are from Australia, and your shipment did not arrive and you did not elect to leave bad feedback beforehand, contact me and you will get a full reship. I put in way to much hard work to be called a selective scammer and i am sick of it. If you did leave bad feedback because you did not read a couple lines which i urge everyone to do and did not try to resolve it, too bad for you man! If you are one of the good people who understand the risks and have done business in the past, message me and i will of course continue to do business with you.</p>

<p>Love you all!</p>

<p>07-05
<br />Hey guys! I'm sorry to say, i'm thinking of not shipping to Australia anymore. I am getting bad feedback from people who can't be bothered to read my terms and conditions, complain afterwards and even leave feedback before the expected delivery timeframe has passed. That's not fair guys. If you insist on me shipping to Australia, please message me before hand that you explicitly agree to the terms and conditions.</p>

<p>In other news: the very popular Dominoes are expected to make a comeback soon!</p>

<p>04-05
<br />New stock! Some listings have been put back up, others will come back on short notice.</p>

<p>01-05
<br />Happy Holidays all! A couple of notices, due to recent holidays and postal breaks some shipments have terrible delays, even domestic ones. No worries though, they are are slowly rolling in. And another small update: soon new stock and there will be an interesting sale!</p>

<p>17-04
<br />New item listed! Blue Mario Mushrooms, limited stock!</p>

<p>07-04
<br />Good Monday all! Some household announcements:
<br />Please make sure you have read my profile before sending in your question/ordering. A lot of the questions are the same. The same applies of course when you order: make sure you have read everything, because there are no discussions about terms after you have ordered.</p>

<p>Top questions:
<br />1. 
<br />Q: What is your success rate to Australia?
<br />A: We have a very high success rate because we use a special kind of stealth. We have a lot of Australian customers.</p>

<p>2. 
<br />Q: How long does a shipment usually take?
<br />A: Please read our shipping timetable for an approximation.</p>

<p>3. 
<br />Q: My shipment has not yet arrived, what do i do?
<br />A: Send a message where you are from so i can check if there is any information about possible delays in your region. Please also send your transaction details.</p>

<p>20-02
<br />Dear customers and/or party-people!
<br />We are well aware of the current sale system of SR2. We would like to remind you that we are a trusted vendor who have been around, and if you order with us, you can be confident your order gets shipped. To underscore our service, we still maintain our reship policies even after you order with FE!</p>

<p>Customers have vouched for us as a trusted vendor on the forums in the trusted vendor thread, check it out:</p>

<p>http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=25105.0</p>

<p>It is not only a compliment but also an honor!
<br />In short: we have feedback and a solid customer base to show for our honesty so order with confidence because.. you know how WeRoll!</p>

<p>--------------</p>

<p>Why choose us? The WeRoll guarantees:</p>

<p>1. Fast shipping. Seriously, packages are waiting to be stamped and sent out. Within hours, usually quicker.</p>

<p>2. We are secure. We do not mess around with private information. When used, it will be destroyed immediately - no exceptions. Our system runs over a secure network, and the drives are encrypted. If all fails, no data is retrievable - security comes always first! We *NEVER* save any addresses or data like some other vendors do!</p>

<p>3. Service is a standard. There will be no unresponsiveness, ever. We are here to help and serve you. If you have any questions at all, please drop a line!</p>

<p>4. Reliability, you can count on us. We are always there, we ship all week. When you order with us, your order gets shipped the very same day - no bullshit, no delays. If anything comes up, we notify you about the situation as early as possible. We are known for our transparency, efficiency and professionalism. This is why we have been around on basically all markets for so long and we plan to stick around for as long as possible!</p>

<p>What you need to know:</p>

<p>WeRoll has a few principles. We always put security, safety and quality above sloppiness, insecure procedures and cheapness. We are well aware that we are a little more expensive at times. But do you really want to put your security at risk dealing with incompetent and/or incapable vendors?</p>

<p>WeRoll means serious business. We do not mess about and we are for the most part not users ourselves, let alone addicts. We have been around for a while because we believe in honest business principles. Again, we ask you: do you want to deal with a vendor that does this as a hobby, has no real clue what he is doing, cannot apply basic grammar when sending a message, knows nothing really about what he's selling or worse: might even go rogue and leak private data!</p>

<p>Some markets have pulled of amazing scams, stole money from vendors and let people down in the most unmoral way possible. WeRoll came through for it's customers where possible, basically paying for the loss of our customers by sending shipments anyway. Once more we ask you, what vendor do you really want to do business with?</p>

<p>How to order:</p>

<p>1) Browse our listings and select a product.
<br />2) When putting in your address, please use the correct format. Send us your address as you would write it on an envelope yourself.
<br />3) Place your order.
<br />4) If you are a regular customer, we will send you a message that your order has been shipped and mark your order "in transit/shipped". If you have no buying history with us, have no/bad/insufficient stats or live in a high risk country, we will message you and request FE. If you believe we will probably request you to FE, you can speed up the delivery process by finalizing the transaction yourself immediately.
<br />5) We will send your order. For estimated shipping times, see our timetable below.</p>

<p>PS: If you want your order processed as quickly as possible, FE (Release escrow) immediately after you place your order!</p>

<p>Refund policy:
<br />10 percent for new customers, 25 percent for returning customers. In some cases a reship can be discussed. Condition to be met: you have good stats and over 10 successful orders. Shipments to high risk countries do not qualify for refunds/reships (Scandinavian countries, eastern European countries, Australia and shipments outside of Europe). A package is considered lost after 45 days (yes, it can take this long sometimes) and before this time period we will not discuss any refunds or reships. When you order from us you agree to this policy!</p>

<p>Shipping:
<br />We ship all week except for the weekends. We always ship from Germany! Orders placed before 4PM CET (16:00) will be shipped the same day. Orders placed after 4PM will still be sent the same day, but there is no guarantee your order will be processed by the postal service. In that case, it will be processed the next morning.</p>

<p>Problems and complaints:
<br />If there is anything wrong, please contact us first! We are always willing to make a deal and work it out. If you leave negative feedback beforehand, or are just plain rude or otherwise, we wont even talk to you anymore. Please be nice, we always try to help!</p>

<p>Forum:
<br />Leaving feedback in the forums is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Shipping Timetable:
<br />Please note: the data below is an approximation of delivery times. Please bear in mind we cannot account for (bank) holidays, postal service delays and other influences we have no control over.

<p>FAQ:</p>

<p>Q: How do you ship? Do i have to sign?
<br />A: Shipping is done discreetly, boring business style. You will never have to sign, and it will fit all mailboxes.</p>

<p>Q: Can we meet in person?
<br />A: Of course not. That would be really silly and not safe at all.</p>

<p>Q: I am 0.xxx amount short of buying your product, can you give me a better price?
<br />A: No, BTC rates are known to change within hours/minutes. Buy a little more so you do not end up short.</p>

<p>Q: Can you give me a sample?/Can you give me a sample, i promise i will buy big next time.
<br />A: No, our products are known to be top quality. Big buyers do not ask for samples.</p>

<p>Q: Why do i have to pay more for shipping to Australia, country a, x or y? That is racist/discrimination/bullshit! (Yes it has been sent exactly like that)
<br />A: It is because we like to rotate our style of packaging for some countries, and because some borders are a little bit tougher to get through, we need/want to spend a little more attention to these particular shipments. We believe this is for your own good. "A little more attention to this shipment today, keeps the love letter away" is what we sometimes joke (ok, not really, we aren't that cheesy :) ).</p>

<p>Q: What's your name? Have i seen you on other markets? Are you a girl?!
<br />A: I'm Cathy, yes WeRoll has been/is active on other markets and yes i am actually female (this appears to be a shocker to some haha!).</p>

<p>Q: I received a broken pill! Can i get a reship/refund?
<br />A: No, broken pills are part of the game. Furthermore it is not our fault but the mailman's/postal service. Besides, a broken pill will do it's job just fine.</p>
