<p>Also, here is Grass Roots review of our products:</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />-- URGENT NOTICES-- READ THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY --
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />New rules!
<br />1. A package is NOT late until 4 days have passed for domestic. 7 working days have passed for EU and 21 working days have passed for all other post.
<br />2. Only send a message once. We have had a huge increase in orders, this puts strain on all of our staff, and we are getting through triple the amount of product and putting out a hell of a lot more packages. This has led to a rethink of how we run things, new staff are being trained up and we are increasing security on the way we receive stock. Until we get everything running smoothly there will be delays and slow responses. This is all in trying to get a smoother more efficient service with lower prices. So stick it out with us for a better future service! If you have any problems, comments, or concerns (reships, order status, if you just want to chat) please send us a message to RavageTheEarth either here on SR, on the forums, or through our safe-mail account. He takes care of all of those requests and sorts them and then sends them to ACE in a neat and organized fashion. 
<br />3. Due to the increase in demand we now ship from France and Northern Spain. Where your package ships from will depend on where product is located. Please ask us if you have a preference and we will try and accommodate.
<br />If you find that the market is down you can join our mailing list and receive special offers or direct sales at TSCrew@safe-mail.net just ask or an addition to the list.
<br />Last but not least check our review page for up to date info, new products, emergency status´ etc. Please join the forum and hang out with us on our review page. We maintain a very close relationship with all of our customers through this thread and would love to see you hang out with us! We are constantly handing out freebies to top contributors of the thread.

<br />==================================
<br />Now, before you scroll all the way down to our delicious listings, we need to go over a few important things. Please read through this ENTIRE page BEFORE you make your first purchase with us. Thank you!
<br />==================================
<br />Table of Contents:
<br />1) FEEDBACK (also updated regularly so we’re always sharing our most recent reviews)
<br />2) TERMS AND CONDITIONS (read carefully BEFORE placing an order with us)
<br />3) PLACING AN ORDER
<br />4) SHIPPING & PACKAGING
<br />5) COMMUNICATIONS
<br />6) TSC PLATINUM SERVICE
<br />7) NEW LISTINGS
<br />==================================
<br />FEEDBACK
<br />==================================
<br />Recent feedback copy and pasted from our profile:
<br />•"Shipping is discreet and well within the time range listed on profile. Product is A+++++++, definitely for serious connoisseurs. Vendor answered questions promptly and helpfully. One of the best on SR"

<br />best customer service I’ve ever encountered on SR. fast responding, friendly communication. Btw fastest shipping, 1 business day for over 2000km of distance. And I got 25g+ for free as a contest prize!"
<br />==================================
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />==================================
<br />Customer satisfaction is our number one goal. If something goes wrong we will do everything we can to make it right. We are an honest and kind group of people and when you deal with us we expect the same from you. With that in mind, please understand that the following is to protect not only TSC, but you and the entire SR community, as well.
<br />Sadly, like many other vendors, we have had issues with buyers trying to scam us. We lose around 4 - 6 % of profits in the EU and around 9 % of profits worldwide reshipping products so in order to keep our prices low and to ensure every transaction goes as smoothly as possible we’ve had to implement some new rules. Please make sure you read and understand the new terms and conditions before placing an order with us. If you do not meet these requirements we will be forced to cancel your order:
<br />** The only buyers that need FE are people with 20% or more refund rates, 15% or more Auto Finalize rate or under 3 successful transactions here on SR.2
<br />** Buyers on the Vendor Blacklist please DO NOT place an order with us. We check EVERY buyer before we accept an order. If you do not meet this requirement please do not message us and ask for an exception. We will not sell to you.
<br />** USA, Canada and Europe only- a 50% refund or reship can be arranged. Due to many people scamming us and saying that they never received their package we can only offer one reship which will be approved after doing a quick background check of the customer asking for the reship through the forums. We know many of our customers personally from talking on the forums and have no problem sending them a reship if they don’t receive their package. We do many things to change our stealth often so 99.9% of the packages should be landing safely and we implement this one reship rule having complete faith in our new methods of shipping. You WILL get your order quickly and safely 99.9% of the time. From now forward reships are going to be a rare occurrence. We are a smart group of people so please don’t try to take advantage of our kindness trying to double your order asking for a reship. We will know what is going on. That being said we WILL give you a reship if you never received your package. The entire goal of TSC is to get product into our customer’s hands and that is what we do best!
<br />** AU ONLY- no refund for missing packages. We offer the option of a reship with tracking number. However, Aussie buyers with less than 4 purchases, more than a 10% refund rate OR over 30% auto finalize rate will receive NO refund and NO re-ship. Like stated above, the one reship rule applies here also. As we all know AU is a high risk place to try to get a package too. We are confident in our stealth though and there is a very high chance that you will receive your order every time. Even in AU!
<br />** All other refund and reship claims will be dealt with on a case by case basis
<br />** We reserve the right to cancel an order and issue full refund without notice
<br />** No refunds after a reship. You must finalize before we post the reship.
<br />** We will not accept orders to Poste Restantes
<br />** Please leave a truthful review AFTER you receive the product. If you leave a bad review if you didn’t receive your package we reserve the right to deny you a reship. The whole point of reships is to get you your product so you can leave an honest review of the product and so you can have a product to enjoy!
<br />**Lastly, if you have any problems, comments, or concerns (reships, order status, if you just want to chat) please send us a message. Ravage takes care of all of those requests and sorts them and then sends them to ACE in a neat and organized fashion. 
<br />==================================
<br />PLACING AN ORDER
<br />==================================
<br />Please provide your information as you would address an envelope since we C&P to ensure complete accuracy:
<br />Full Name (First, Last)
<br />Street, house number
<br />CITY, (with the area code next to it in brackets)
<br />COUNTRY
<br />Please use your REAL NAME or the name of someone who is known to live at delivery address.
<br />THE SITE MAY BE COMPROMISED THEREFORE:
<br />We HIGHLY SUGGEST you use PGP encryption when placing your order. It is for YOUR protection, not ours. Here are some links to help you get started:
<br />Tutorial by SR forum member Astor, It is a brilliant read and is easy to understand.
<br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/
<br />We suggest you download Gpg4usb, and use PGP encryption when you communicate with us. It is not compulsory, but it is for your benefit.
<br />Why not do it now and import our public key, then send us a test message to see if you got the hang of it. Security is paramount in this game, so make sure you don´t cut any corners!
<br />Download for Win, Mac and Linux.
<br />http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html
<br />You’ll find our public key in the last section.
<br />Upon package arrival, please finalize the order as soon as possible. This helps us get restocks in earlier so we don´t keep anyone waiting. Note that feedback can always be edited to include a review of the product at a later time.
<br />We have added an 'ADD ON ITEM' shipping option to some of our smaller quantity listings and Weekend Kits. Please add shipping to the biggest item of you order and use the 'ADD ON ITEM' option ONLY in the following circumstances:
<br />1) You are purchasing more than one listing
<br />2) Total weight of all listings is under 40g
<br />We will be forced to cancel the order if you do not meet these requirements.
<br />==================================
<br />SHIPPING & PACKAGING
<br />==================================
<br />We ship Monday through Saturday twice a day, FE orders will be posted no later than 6 hours after the FE. All of our packages are DOUBLE vacuum-sealed and STEALTHY! Using the latest in package stealth techniques on the dark-web, we have one of the lowest package non arrival % due to the meticulous care we take in planning and prepping the packages. We change packaging styles and formats regularly to keep one step ahead of LE. So don´t be surprised if different orders some through with different appearance. We now use an outer MBB layer for ALL packages.
<br />(NOTE THE FOLLOWING EXCLUDES CHRISTMAS AND OTHER EXTENDED HOLIDAY DATES)
<br />Estimated shipping times (this is just our best guess based on feedback from buyers, times are NOT guaranteed):
<br />Spain: 2 - 4 working days
<br />EU: 3 working days - 1.5 weeks
<br />US and Canada: 1-2 weeks (US domestic shipping of hash coming soon!)
<br />AU: 1-5 weeks delivery. AGAIN, no refund for missing packages, only the option of a reship with tracking number. Aussie buyers with less than 4 purchases, more than 10% refund OR over 30% Auto Finalize will NOT receive a refund or re-ship. Sorry, Aussie friends :(
<br />Rest of World: 1-6 weeks
<br />Only *ONE* reship is allowed. You can read the reasons for this in the “Terms & Conditions” section.
<br />==================================
<br />COMMUNICATION
<br />==================================
<br />The Scurvy Crew is here for you! Feel free to message us with any questions. DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE THE SUBJECT LINE. Put whatever you want in there, just don't leave it blank. The only questions we ignore are the ones that are answered here (for instance, "when will my package arrive?") Like we stated earlier the fastest way to receive a response is to message
<br />“RavageTheEarth” either here, on the SR forums, or through our email (TSCREW@lelantos.org). He prides himself in providing extremely fast response times. Contact him for anything from reships to comments and concerns.
<br />==================================
<br />TSC PLATINUM SERVICE
<br />==================================</p>

<p>So the current situation is this: We currently accept orders from SR2 and direct orders through email to TSCREW@lelantos.org. Our end goal is to be a specialist Hash and opium seller, we will sell only to a very select group of clients, any new customers will only be accepted after rigorous background checks and vetting, Sales will be completed through email, direct sales site or a third solution we are looking into based on a hardened torified encrypted phone offered to our top end clients.
<br />Think of this as the next level up of the current direct sales solution, we will endeavor to run all consecutive until we see what the future of dark web sites, in particular SR2.
<br />The benefits of this will be the following.
<br />1. A one to one relationship with all of our clients allowing for a personalized service. We will know your tastes and preferences and you will have a specialist TSC staff member assigned to you. We will source specifically for you based on your average spending, the qualities and types you like, and any products you are interested in. It’s like a platinum service for all clients, we become your friendly one stop drug shop, you shoot us a message on what you like and we move heaven and earth to get it using our extensive contacts around the world. We will also implement rolling contracts and accounts: Basically we keep you supplied without having to place orders all the time, based on how much you consume, you keep your account topped up and we send you weekly, bi-weekly and monthly packages without needing to go through the order process each time. Depending on the time you have been with us, credit lines are also available.
<br />2. Hash quality, Due to buyer scams on all the markets, the varying percentages all the markets charge on sales, the huge overheads involved in keeping us up and running, the forums, the listings, the resolution center cases, lost packages, around 40% of our revenue is reinvested on just keeping us operational. With the money we would save on this by only dealing directly with select clients we can use the money saved to obtain higher quality hash, or hash that is more risky or harder to source. These gourmet hashes that we have looked into, are the next level in privately produced hash, As a pose to mass produced hash´s, like our Ketama hash from Morocco, which is still of excellent quality, We would opt to source most of our hash from small private suppliers that produce their product for non-monetary reasons, these suppliers use the best most expensive plants, and produce primarily for their own consumption or exhibitions or competitions (think cannabis cup style). They use exotic blends in their production. An example from our last meeting with these guys was a 00 hash produced from a 60% 40% mix of Amnesia Haze and Sour Diesel, Working with these guys mean that we could offer custom orders based on what our customers prefer, say we have a customer that really likes oil or shatter, this customer also really likes our power widow hash. Well on request we could offer our customer BHO made from the power widow plants... Anyway, you get the idea.
<br />3. Security. The obvious one here. With all of these new markets springing up all over the place, there is no real trust in who you are allowing to view your sensitive data. TSC has been around since day 1. From the original SR we have been a part of the TOR revolution since its baby steps. We never scammed, we never cheated, and we even resent packages for the markets that closed when we had no obligation to do so, taking the loss ourselves. We did this because we are honest, we love our customers and we love the job that we do. We are so proud that our customers trust us to the extent that they do. We have customers that just drop BTC in our wallet and with a one line email know that they will receive their goods. No escrow, not even operating through a site. This is true trust, and this is the relationship we love.
<br />So, for now we will be on SR2 for as long as it lasts and is secure. We will accept orders as usual. However we are actively looking amongst our customers and inviting members to be a part of our direct sales system, in fact we have been doing this for the past 4 months. From these members over the next few weeks we will be selecting the most trusted to join out platinum service. If SR2 one day shuts down, the chances are we will not reopen on the next site to come around. We will send out a mass email to our selected clients (both direct sales and platinum service members) and advise that the above solution is now in place. And we will invite you to join the exclusive TSC direct sales system.
<br />(PLATINUM SERVICE UPDATE)
<br />I am aware that these circumstances are neither your fault nor our faults, however have chosen to use this opportunity to expand the hand chosen list for our platinum direct sales service. Over the years due to our dedication and product quality we have grown substantially, far more than I ever wanted or dreamed. My dream for TSC was to be a connoisseurs club, selling only the best products to a hand vetted client base. Our reputation is one of the best, we are above the rest and our orders per day kept growing and growing, this pushed us to a choice, to become huge and sacrifice our excellent personal customer relations and support, or to go independent and become an exclusive club. Our only competition in the hash sector was ATLAS, and we plan to follow in his steps. So I will use this opportunity to fill this month’s quotas of additions to the TSC platinum service. If you like our products and the way we operate, understand that the people who stick with us through these tough times, market after market, that are patient and prove to be loyal will be rewarded for demonstrating your trust in us, We now have the client base to become an exclusive seller, providing a tailored and private service to a select group of customers. This will enable us to utilize the money saved from the current site costs to buy even higher quality products, source specialty products upon request and assign a personal TSCrew staff member per customer (in groups) for a tailored service. Please read the last point on our profile for a more detailed explanation of the platinum club.
<br />When we begin to operate our direct sales platinum service, the people that prove their loyalty and trust in this testing time will be given the opportunity to join as basic platinum members as part of the existing hand chosen member list.
<br />Again a full announcement on this service we plan to offer is at the bottom of our profile.
<br />With regards to the recent site announcements, the possible loss of over 20,000EUR in escrow is another blow, in addition to the SR1 losses, SHEEP losses and BMR losses we have lost well over 200,000 Euros, I believe everything happens for a reason, and this reason gave me the incentive I needed to make the platinum service a #1 priority. The platinum service aims to be a personally tailored service for ALL of the needs of our hand selected clients, including credit lines, personally appointed adviser, personal recommendations on new drugs and services, an extensive range of contacts for everything from BTC cash outs, buy ins, fake documentation, investments, and for upper level clients personal sourcing of current Items we do not stock. In effect we will be the one stop shop, with multiple ways of ordering. even directly from a torified phone which we can supply, Deliveries to hotels, courier express, deliveries weekly updates, order tracking, points systems so you can ascend or descend in member importance, thus giving or taking away benefits based on behavior and loyalty, tailored sales lists based on income and average spending and a whole host of other services. Remember it is not how much you spend with us that will influence the whole decision, we value people that regularly buy their personal amount weekly and keep coming back, people that stick with us through thick and thin, it is the way you chose to deal with us, the trust you put in us, the frequency of orders and time you have spent with us as a Screwbie, hat will decide if you are chosen or not. We are the first to implement such a club and we operate a basic non platinum direct sales version at the moment, in 6 months we will be ready for the full platinum service to go live.
<br />*** Since I posted this announcement I have had hundreds of messages begging to be considered for the club, please note those messages decrease the chances of you being chosen, we want true, honest, good hearted people, people we can trust and people who know what trust really means, STOP sending begging messages, no one will be chosen for the platinum service on request. TSC meets weekly as a team and review that week’s orders, we review order problems and difficult customers, we cross check the problem and scammer buyer sections on the vendor round table. We review messages that through their honesty and friendliness should be brought to light, from those weekly meetings we draw up monthly summaries, the 5 people at the top each month will get sent the message when we are ready. The selected members will be offered an introductory credit line based on past spending and a generous interlocutory welcome package. We want you to feel as one of us, as if you were here with us, if you are selected then you earned it. It is not a club for blaggers, beggars and scroungers. It’s for the elite SRians, the gold people who know what loyalty means. For the Platinum customer orders we are working on a way we can contact more directly. For our platinum member we will offer a service like no other, envied throughout the dark-web, if you need the drugs by the weekend they will fucking be there, if you need a kilo of a special hash you once smoked in morocco and never managed to find again we will find it and bring it safely to your door. You get the gist. It´s one of the most talked about market alternatives at the mo. We are currently deciding if to charge a member fee or not, I vote not to, because I don´t want to exclude anyone for financial reasons, but then again it would only work if people were placing orders. Noncontributing/buying members would no bring it to its full potential, though you would see prices at around 25% reduction from current listing prices for the same hash. However that would make up a small part of the stock as we would be stocking mainly some of the highest grade hash money and amazing contacts can buy. So the membership fees something I would like feedback from ideally from old Screwbies. Also another idea of having a gateway using Google authenticator or RSA keys which would be issued and required for every access and order perhaps in discrete credit card format style with a cool logo. Nothings decided yet, and the first members would help us shape it up for the rest.
<br />We hope this situation on SR2 to improve dramatically now that we have moved to countries with a much more competent postal service. It has always been our hope to be able to continue to offer the regular market service that has us regularly mentioned as number 1 at the same time as the platinum service. But for this to happen a lot must change, and a lot must be proven by the new SR2 admins, whoever they may be.
<br />NOTE ON NEW PRODUCTS TO BE LISTED LATE APRIL:
<br />1. We are in the final stages of negotiating 3 new products for sale, they will be long awaited coke, Steroids and a whole host of benzos at incredible prices, everything from Xanax bars, Valium, zopiclone, ambien etc.
<br />2. I will also be offering free cycle advice for steroid use, with every purchase we will work with you to find the best steroid or combination of steroids for first time users or people that want to use for specifics - bulking, toning, strength, low natural testosterone levels etc... I will provide a full plan for your cycle, including PCT and we will be supplying all the equipment needed ready to go as a full kit. The kit which will cover you with everything from syringes, gloves, needles etc. for inject-able cycles, to milk thistle and protections for oral based (less recommend cycles) for a cycle lasting anywhere from 6 - 18 weeks. This can be broken down into smaller bi-weekly payments if necessary.
<br />These are the real deal not the Indian knock offs, They are individual, legitimate, dosed glass ampule steroids and not the shitty god knows what multi-dose bottles you find on the net, they are the ones I use when I need bulk up fast. You´ll look like a fucking bull within the first 6 weeks if you follow our plan. I have a lot of experience using them, studying them and being around people that use them regularly and can offer as good as advice on them as I can opium.
<br />Also note that medium acting testosterone ethers like Testosterone Ethanate come to mind as the most commonly used and are excellent for people with low testosterone levels, If you suffer from continual fatigue, little to no sex drive not even porn turns you on, difficult waking up and generally feeling less confident / manly than usual then give it a go, if done properly the risks are minimal and the gains huge, I know it has changed people’s lives.
<br />The only things that will not be included that you MUST follow (will be included in your tailor made plan) are changes in diet, Exercise will also be discussed if desired for anything other than natural low test levels and plenty of sleep. I also suggest you purchase supplements like whey protein, creatine, joint care supplements, and a slimming aid if you are starting of rather tubby, which is not a bad thing actually as you will see good results. If you follow my advice and take your medicine I can have the skinniest geekiest person on SR looking like a club bouncer in two months.
<br />3. We are re-introducing several kits. The first which you will find on all of our listings is the “What Happened” Weekend Warrior Kits!!
