<br />-NEWS-
<br />------
<br />☞2014-04-11☜
<br />+I now have ounces of California grown Orange Crush cannabis for sale. They ship with free EMS. I do not wish to sell in smaller amounts. I suggest you read up on the strain as I likely cannot answer questions as I do not smoke or use anything, strictly business only.
<br />+Likely the next batch of cocaine to be posted will be sold by the ounce or 1/2 as well.</p>

<p>☞2014-04-06☜
<br />+Im no longer traveling, but have been sick for the past 5 days and unable to work as fast as I usually do on SR, even unable to login to SR. Orders and regular business have resumed as of today. I of course as usual have an inbox of 442 messages as everyone uses me for advice and consulting, so please give me time to reply. I never ignore anyone so if your messages still needs a reply please wait.
<br />+Right now cocaine is out of stock, however it will be restocked as soon as I can get more. As always I try to obtain the best quality I can and when we are dealing with a product produced in a 3rd world nation by people not using pharmaceutical labs and by people without pharmacology knowledge who have not completed high school, then it makes all of this hard from the beginning meaning kilos made in the same batch can vary in quality so I have to negotiate like a Russian horse trader to ensure the finest quality.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-27☜
<br />+I am currently traveling right now and due to that matter I am accepting orders and processing the orders, but forgery items will print and ship Monday at the latest and cocaine orders will ship Monday at the latest as well. I hate to have delays on orders, but in the meantime I am processing the orders and keeping the finished item PGP encrypted, then will print and ship once I am able. Ordinarily vendors put their account in "vacation mode" and no further orders can be placed, but instead I decided to compromise and allow orders to be placed and processed then shipped once I return.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-22☜
<br />+The pure uncut cocaine listing has been restocked. I can honestly say it is high quality and likely some of the best on SR and I am purposely selling it for less than I could sell it for to undercut the market and begin to build a customer base. There are listings on SR for coke that is nearly if not identical to mine that is selling for $20 to $30 more per gram for the same exact stuff, so take advantage of this offer.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-16☜
<br />+I'm caught up on orders, however I still am working through my inbox. I will answer all messages as quickly as possible. I have been working hard to keep up with the tax return season rush where everyone spends their returns here on SR.
<br />+I would also like to acknowledge that indeed SR has been paying me for the funds that were stolen during the BTC hacking. The admins and DPR are true to their word and they are paying us vendors back. I knew they would, but wanted to express to the community that indeed they are honest.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-12☜
<br />+I have a large amount of orders right now as in the U.S. residents are just getting their federal tax refunds and just like last year they come to SR to spend it. I am doing my best to stay on top of these orders, but have had health issues and been in the ER but by no means will I not process orders or answer messages. However it may take an extra day due to the high traffic started by the tax refunds. By no means is the high traffic bad as this economic stimulus is an excellent thing as all of the SR items either travel through postal services that pay middle class people or travels through the internet run by ISPs and server hosting companies that employ people of all classes for numerous jobs. So keep the funds rolling through SR.
<br />+A portion of all revenue from my SR activity is always donated to charity. I always allow all of you the buyers and SR users that the funds sourced from a chance to message me a suggest a charity.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-11☜
<br />+I have decided not to sell forged currency, and have decided not to use it as well. It creates victims in the act of the crime that are the ones who suffer. Just as I never sell or buy information of real people, I simply make forgeries with information that was provided by the buyer. As odd as it may sound to turn down printing money, I do have a set of rules beyond that of the SR vendor rules and a level of integrity.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-05☜
<br />+Forged checks are now for sale.</p>

<p>☞2014-03-04☜
<br />+I am on top of all orders and shipments are being processed quickly and shipped quickly so now is a great time to order.
<br />+I have also added a BTC address below in my profile as many have asked where they can donate BTC or how they can leave a gratuity.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-22☜
<br />+Opium Poppy seeds are now for sale and back in stock in time for spring! These sold like crazy on SR 1.0 and I expect them to sell very fast.
<br />+IMPORTANT: As SR staff got overwhlmed with messages recently and decided to delete all unanswered ones and start fresh to stay on top of the messages and made me choose to do the same. If you sent me a message before Feb 20, 2014 and it is unanswered then please resend it so I can stay on top of my messages and start fresh just like the SR staff planned. This will make all replies and orders come faster.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-20☜
<br />+I have just released forged paystubs and they are on sale at 50% off for the first 3 buyers.
<br />+For those of you who placed orders with me while SR was down or have sent a message since it came back up and have not heard back dont worry I am swamped like SR staff and will have everything worked out in less than 24 hours, just havent slept for 2 days and can see the sun comming up and dont want to make it 3 days. Keep in mind the SR staff is living just like me, without sleep or any AFK time as we are all serving all of you.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-19☜
<br />+I now offer forged Rx labels for the Rowlands Pharmacy located in the UK. They are on sale at 50% off for the first 3 buyers.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-18☜
<br />+I HAVE A NEW PGP KEY, SO PLEASE BE MINDFUL TO UPDATE YOUR KEYRINGS TO MY NEW KEY
<br />+While SR was down I spent the time increasing OPSEC and creating new forgeries. I have a handful of new goodies for all of you who use my products.</p>

<p>+For those of you mad at the SR staff do not be. At any other market place the staff would have fled by now. The SR staff believes in all of us and in SR so much so they will fight and work for us without pay. They are not here for drugs or money as the vast majority are, they are true believers with their hearts and minds in the right place, standing their ground and with that ground covered in metaphorical blood and spent cases still smoking at their feet, with rounds in their flak jackets causing them pain, they choose not to retreat... THEY CHOSE TO RELOAD! And so do I, let the empty magazine fall from the reciever and hit the blood soaked sands, as the "click" of a new one replacing the empty one echos through the darkweb, arms at condition zero prepared to face any foe that threatens our existance or our freedom because we are more that miles of ethernet chord, more than servers, more than intelligent men behind computers; we are an idea and ideas are bulletproof.
<br />If you read this then message one of the SR staff and thank them, speak from the heart and tell them why you are thankful and why SR is so important to you.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-12☜
<br />+Forged PG&E utility bills are now for sale in the market place as my newest item.
<br />+Currently have an Ergo electricity bill in the works for Australian buyers so expect it to be listed in 2 days or so.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-07☜
<br />+I have now implemented changes in my shipping method that will decrease the amount of time it takes to process and ship an order. This means orders will be shipped sooner by about one day and in some cases two days sooner on some select items. This will not effect the prices on any item or on the price of shipping. No extra steps need to be taken by buyers; this is simply an announcement of an upgrade I have made as a vendor. Please keep in mind that this does not decrease the time it takes for the shipping company (USPS) to deliver the item, this upgrade decreases the time between the buyer ordering and the item being shipped and handed over to the shipping company; none the less after implementing this change 2 days ago it has already had a huge positive impact in my efficiency.
<br />+Since I have been backed up on messages and orders for the past week, I can no say I am almost caught up on messages and orders are being processed much faster thanks to the shipping upgrade I made. As always if your order is urgent or you need it asap then make sure to consider purchasing express processing along with your order and/or also selecting a faster shipping method such as priority or EMS.</p>

<p>☞2014-02-01☜
<br />+Very sorry to be missing from SR for nearly 2 days. I can only imagine how some of you must have been worried and scared. I simply had a quick onset of illness that kept me immobile. Last time this happened a rumor circulated that namedeclined was dead, glad that did not happen.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-24☜
<br />+I now offer Sony Vegas Pro 10.0 as a hacked portable copy. It is on sale for the first three buyers.
<br />+I had a system crash this week so there is a delay on answering messages and delays on all custom orders.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-18☜
<br />+A new forgery item has just launched and is on sale at 50% off for the first 3 buyers! The new item is forged CVS Pharmacy Rx labels. I have both the regular 3 label set and the one year supply 12 label set. Both of which are on sale. With the addition of these CVS labels I now offer forged WalMart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid and Kaiser prescription labels. I hope to add more in the near future. If you have an original of a prescription label that I do not offer contact me and we can work something out so that I can begin to offer that pharmacy as well.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-15☜
<br />+As of now the onion site TorImages is not loading or responding. It may only be down for maintenance or temporarily, but for those of you who are ordering forgeries that require you to provide me with an image please use the site anonfiles.com and provide me with the link to your image. As always only access that site through tor.
<br />+I am in the process of writing an ebook that will explain step by step accompanied by pictures how to set up an anonymous cell phone and not have it be traced to you.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-14☜
<br />+Forged Australian Queensland drivers license is now for sale. It is currently on sale for the first 3 buyers as a new item promotion. This item is part of a campaign I have been running since SR 1.0 in  order to offer more items geared towards the Australian market as they make up a large part of SR. If you have any Australian documents or IDs you would like me to offer as a listing contact me and I can tell you how to deliver a scan of the original item.
<br />+Just as the SR staff and admins are backed up with high volume of work and messages I too am undergoing the same thing. I am doing my best to accommodate everyone and staying up till sunrise nearly every night to do so. I am giving up sleep, my social life, and even staying parked on my computer for durations of 12 hours just to serve all of you. I dont mind it, in fact I live for it, every second. My point merely is please bear with me as all of us work through this busy time on SR. My goal is to get caught up by the end of the month in time for the tax season rush when many SR users spend their tax refund here on SR creating a huge volume of orders.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-06☜
<br />+Forged Australian NSW drivers license digital scan copies are now for sale. The first 3 buyers get it for next to nothing. In addition I will always be selling it cheaper than all other vendors here on Silk Road no matter what, so always buy from me.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-05☜
<br />+I grossly underestimated how many people on Silk Road would be interested in free porn. After posting the listing for the free porn movie in the middle of the night, I woke up to find half of the free downloads already claimed.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-04☜
<br />+Forged Japan ID Digital Scan Copies are now for sale. As a beta test the first 3 will be priced at 50% off in order to get the item rated and established in the market. Hurry before the sale ends!
<br />+A listing that is 100% percent free has been posted. It is for a free porn movie and the first 100 people to order the listing will get the free movie!</p>

<p>☞2014-01-03☜
<br />+Since SR is the only major deepweb market in operation, thus users from all other sites are offloaded to SR; it creates higher traffic here on SR, more orders for me and many more messages comming from people just discovering me who came from other markets. So I am swamped on messages and orders but working round the clock to answer all messages and complete all orders.
<br />+First donation of the new year was made today. I donated a portion of my SR profits to a charity that helps fight drug abuse (I realize it is ironic given SR is a site that primarily sells drugs) and bring awareness to drug abuse. I cannot say how much, which charity or how the donation was made as it has to stay anonymous. Keep in mind it wasnt me who funded the donation it was all of you who bought from me.</p>

<p>☞2014-01-02☜
<br />+Happy New Year Silk Road! This NYE just like last year's NYE I spent both the NYE and the first few hours of th new year on SR working hard to serve all of you as I has a huge surge in messages and orders. However this year I did not do so in a five star hotel in the city in th high roller room after a night at a night club, I had a more low key celebration, but still spent on SR with all of you. I suppose after last year where despite the fact that I was sober and sat calmly working on my laptop on SR in my suite the hotel manager and police still felt the need to come to my room to demand the excess amount of female guests leave and turn in their wrist bands, they were a bit noisy, barely clothed and technically not listed as guests as only one female was. Police never saw my computer screen asked what I was doing or had any idea as to who I really was. Point is I found it interesting how happily bringing in a new year was put to a hault yet my actions on SR were not.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-25☜
<br />+Merry Christmas Silk Road! I plan to work on orders today and develop new forgery items. Thank you to the Silk Road staff and forum moderators who will be working today implementing the Silk Road upgrades. I pray and hope that DPR is safe and well and am thankful for all of his hard work; DPR I hope you have a merry Christmas. Giving us vendors access to Silk Road during the holiday break is a gift all in its own. 
<br />+I am working on implementing even more security proceedures that I will follow on top of the already extensive list of protocols I already have and will be adding some instructions here on my profile for my clients to follow to ensure they keep things anonymous and secure on their end.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-24☜
<br />+While many are celebrating the holidays I am multitasking and have decided to work on SR as us vendors are given access to SR during the holiday break. Last year I worked the 24th and 25th and this year will do the same. In addition a few clients on here needed emergancy help from so I happily came to their aid during the holidays.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-22☜
<br />+I have a lot of messages to work through right now. I will be working during the holidays including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to respond to everyone. I enjoy conversing and answering my messages and put custom answers and care into each one so it does take time. If inportant please indicate so in the subject line. I hope all of you a have a Merry Christmas and my all of you remember and pray for soldiers overseas who dedicate so much and are unable to be home with their families this season.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-14☜
<br />+Im a bit backed up on messages but all will be answered in the next 24 hours.
<br />+Also yes I am slow on changing my sale prices back to normal, but oh well next 24 hours it is the benefit of the buyers.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-08☜
<br />+During Thanksgiving I took a portion of all Silk Road profits and used it to buy canned food to donate to a canned food drive and now that it is the Holidays I plan to take a portion of all Silk Road profits and purchase children's toys to donate to Toys for Tots as it is an excellent charity and can be done so anonymously.
<br />+My 50% off sale has been extended and will end on Monday at midnight.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-05☜
<br />+ALL OF THE MOST POPULAR FORGERY LISTINGS WILL BE ON SALE AT 50% OFF OR MORE FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS! ORDER FAST BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT! (sale ends 2013-12-07 10:52 hours EST)
<br />+I have PURE MDMA crystals that will soon be available for sale in small amounts and in bulk. Message me if you like the idea and support it.</p>

<p>☞2013-12-04☜
<br />+All of my forgery listings are now up.
<br />+Adobe InDesign will soon be avalible for sale.
<br />+Please be advised that Adobe orders may have a delay while I get them uploaded.
<br />+FORGED SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS ARE ON SALE AT 50% OFF FOR THE NEXT 5 BUYERS!!!!</p>

<p>☞2013-11-29☜
<br />+I spent Thanksgiving on Silk Road and Sheep tending to orders and posting all of my forged prescription labels and a few other items. It was my please to spend the day both on with all of you and enjoying the holiday feast.</p>

<p>+As of now do not order from me on DeepBay. DeepBay has been abandoned by the Admins and owner(s). No idea why or what the situation is, but if anyone has any insight as to what is going on please inform me. The DeepBay forums are also down. The most recent activity on the site was on November 9th and since then all communication from admins has ceased and many vendors have reported not being able to login. I can only recall right before the 9th users were unable to withdraw funds then the site mysteriously turned into a ghost town. Eventually all listings as they can only be up for 12 months max before they must be re listed will expire or before that the site may just disappear if payment for or servicing of the servers is not met. Only time will tell. With that said order from me on here, and as a back up use Sheep, but please use SR first as we need to support it and it is our home.</p>

<p>+I'm getting a decent amount of messages asking about if or when I will be on BMR. I have Silk Road so what more could I ask for, but in the sense of business I do plan on expanding to BMR, but the site needs to stabilize first and get running seamlessly.</p>

<p>☞2013-11-28☜
<br />+Happy Thanksgiving! I am very thankful to be on Silk Road 2.0, Sheep, DeepBay and thankful for everyone on these places that supports me. As always I donate portions of my online profits to charity. This Thanksgiving I took a portions of profits, purchased canned food and donated it to ensure those less fortunate are fed. The hit the BTC industry and the first Silk Road took did make many of us feel less fortunate, however we need to remember there are those who truly less fortunate than all of us even on our worst days. We are in a position to help and do good.</p>

<p>☞2013-11-27☜
<br />+Possible associate has come to me with a way to counterfeit BTC, more later on this if it plays out...</p>

<p>☞2013-11-23☜
<br />Great to be back on SR as my last time on SR was Oct 1, 2013 at around 04:30 hours, right before the take down. Over the next few days I will be re posting all of my listings that I previously offered before.</p>

<p>---------------------------
<br />-Mission Statement-
<br />---------------------------
<br />My mission statement to make it my goal to receive 100% positive feed back on each transaction. To provide prompt responses to all of my customers as well as prompt shipping to each customer. To provide un-matched service to all those on Silk Road, both customers and other Vendors. To uphold each and every policy that Silk Road holds it's users and vendors to. To maintain the highest level of privacy and anonymity to my customers with highly discreet shipping of all orders as I have seen and have been informed how Federal postal inspectors are trained and what they look for. To provide a diverse inventory and unique shopping experience for everyone who visits my listings.</p>

<p>------
<br />-Bio-
<br />------
<br />I have a high level of experience in this business. My work in the labs to lurking in the shadows of the darkest corners of the internet in cyber space beside Anonymous; I have gained experience and skills from street level to white collar crimes, to counterfeiting, to work as a lieutenant in a South Korean organized crime ring (I was the only white one lol) here in the United States. In addition I have a high level of experience here on deepweb marketplaces. I was a vendor for over one year on the original Silk Road 1.0, then opened up a vendor account on Atlantis operating on there during the entire life of Atlantis, I operated on DeepBay with a category all to myself after requesting it while negotiating for all SR vendors who had no place to go after SR 1.0 went down to get a free vendor account on DeepBay, I then proceeded to dominate and be the top forger on Sheep before it closed, then returned home here to Silk Road upon the launch of Silk Road 2.0. Loyalty discipline, reliability and privacy are four things you will always get from me. I do not compromise.</p>

<p>----------
<br />-SHIPPING-
<br />----------
<br />Upon the purchase of any item that I offer here on Silk Road there will be a shipping / delivery method that is stated at the bottom of the listing. Most items are items that physically ship through the postal service and will be shipped to an address you provide upon purchase, but a portion of items are digital items that are not printed and physically forged on my end and thus do not need to be physically shipped, and therefore are delivered by being posted anonymously on a file hosting site.</p>

<p>File hosting is free and allows instant delivery (possibly even same day) of digital goods such as scan copies of IDs, software, ebooks, videos and a few other unique items. When the digital item is finished and posted the buyer will have the link privately messaged to their username here on Silk Road. The buyer is required to access the download link and download their purchase while using tor in order to ensure full privacy and to remain anonymous. The file hosted order data will be set to self-delete off the filehosting server. I retain the download link info on hand PGP encrypted and destroy it via the Gutmann method after the sale is final. I ask buyers do not save the link info and delete it after the sale ends as well. The digital items that are file hosted are offered both domestically and internationally, both free of charge.</p>

<p>I offer two categories of shipping. There will be physically shipped items and digitally delivered items. Digital items always ship free and will be delivered over the internet securely. Physically shipped items will have numerous options of shipping for both domestic and international shipments. In most cases the buyer will pay for the shipping postage and the price covers the cost of the postage, the cost of materials such as envelopes, internal packing materials, tape, address labels and cost of the time spent packing the item and ensuring they are correct; is all included in the price of shipping. All physical items will ship with a tracking number as proof it was indeed shipped and will not require a signature upon delivery or in person acceptance nor will EMS items require a signature upon delivery. Tracking numbers are each kept PGP encrypted and any postal records such as a receipt is instantly destroyed in a paper shredder as keeping the tracking number under PGP is the most secure way. After the order has arrived and sale is final the tracking number is deleted with Gutmann file delete method for security. The tracking numbers are not provided to the buyer except under a special circumstance such as the order being reported as not arriving in the expected time frame or if the order is disputed and I need to provide evidence the item shipped and I held up my end. I do this because it protects me and my clients. If I hand it out and say one buyer tracks and item with their real ip address and it gets intercepted then that is evidence that indicates they knew the item was coming and had the intent to take possession of it. Another scenario is that  a buyer may track it through tor and the courier service such as USPS may flag items tracked through tor and possible take a closer look. If that happens then all items shipped at the same time as that one will be looked at. In addition tracking info history is saved for an extended amount of time. Both of the scenarios have added risk when the item is international as customs agents do not need a warrant to open and inspect an item. They have automated servers that look over the digital customs forms associated with each item and will document each ip that tracked it and be able to flag tor ips or suspicious tracking. Each item is packaged so it is discreet while still packed to survive any harsh handling. Any items bought that may have an odor will be vacuum packed in numerous layers for added protection. All items can be felt up by any postal employee that will handle it through it's journey without the ability to allow the postal workers to identify the contents.</p>

<p>Each option of shipping has a different price and estimated time frame of delivery. For domestic shipments first class will arrive in 3 - 4 days (sometimes 2 days in some cases), priority domestic will arrive in 2 - 4 days, and EMS express domestic will arrive in 1 - 2 days. When using EMS domestic as of February 2013 EMS is no longer promised to arrive in one day; and if the destination is located in a remote area or an area that does not have a nearby postal sort facility then EMS may take 2 days instead of simple overnight. If EMS is shipped past 13:00 hours (time at departure location) then EMS may take 2 days instead of 1. If you have a very urgent order then consider purchasing priority processing from me. For the international shipping rates two options are offered. The first is first class mail which delivery time can vary widely depending on distance it must travel as well as the speed and efficiency of the local postal service in the destination country, however first class generally takes around 6 - 10 days. The second international shipping rate offered is EMS express which will take 3 - 7 days. International EMS generally leans towards 3 - 4 days for most destinations, however if a weekend is in the transit window or the destination country has a slower postal service it may take on the longer side. All shipping transit time ETAs can be calculated prior to the buyer purchasing and prior to shipping. Message me with your country and postal code and I can quote you the ETA.</p>

<p>For your security and to ensure there is not any evidence to link you to the purchase you should never allow the mail courier or shipping company to hand you the item. Just let them leave it by your door or place it in your mail box / mail slot. If the item is intercepted then you accepting it hand delivered without stating you have no idea what it is or why it arrived, will make you liable as then they have means to arrest you during the undercover controlled delivery. I ship with USPS so a warrant is needed to open the item, but forgeries are slim and have zero odors and never produce a reason to inspect them. USPS is also the only company that can place items in your mail box so your order will be secure, just don’t let them hand it to you and don’t answer the door, let them leave it in your mail box or slot. The vast majority of the time mail carriers will simply leave it in the mail box / mail slot and will only bring it to the door if it will not fit in the box. Once delivery is complete with you safe, then you should properly destroy the envelope it came it. The best way is to ensure you destroy the address label, the postage stamp / sticker and the tracking number or any other stickers, barcodes or markings that ID it. The ideal way is to make sure the envelope is cut into sheets or sections that can go through a paper shredder. Given it wasn’t tracked, you never took physical possession of it, and you destroyed the envelope; balances out to the order being anonymous and nothing left to link you to it.</p>

<p>--------------------
<br />-EXPRESS PROCESSING-
<br />--------------------
<br />If you need your item in a hurry express processing and overnight EMS shipping is offered. All orders get processed in the order that they were placed. In some instances the situation is urgent and users may depend on my items to help get court charges dropped or aid in passing a drug test or providing ID info to an employer. In these urgent cases or if the buyer simply wants their item asap and does not want to wait as they are excited then they can order their item and then also order the express processing listing along with it. The express processing listing ensures that your item is processed before all other orders despite whether it was placed first or is farther down the list. Essentially it is a cut to the front of the line pass. In addition to cutting to the front of the line, I put all other affairs on hold and focus on the express processing order to get it finished and shipped asap. In some cases express processing orders can even ship out same day. Express processing does not get you EMS express shipping, it simply gets the item processed and shipped out before all others. You (the buyer) must select EMS shipping if you need it when ordering the initial item. The reason the EMS postage is to be bought with the item and not the express processing is merely because many buyers wish to buy EMS shipping, but do not require their order to be processed before all others. The postage is also done this way so that digital goods can be bought with express processing and the buyer will only need to pay for the faster processing solely and not have to pay for postage as digital items are not shipped. Here is the link to the listing for express processing:</p>

<br />-DONATIONS / TIPS-
<br />------------------
<br />In the event that you wish to donate BTC to me or leave a tip as many people have asked how / where to do so; below is a BTC address where deposits may be sent. Thank you to all that do make a deposit there.

<p>--------------------------
<br />-ADDITIONAL SECURITY INFO-
<br />--------------------------
<br />All files I have on hand are kept under PGP encryption. When you place an order it is best to use PGP to secure the data and order forum if one is used on that item. I keep your order forum and your forgery template on hand PGP encrypted until the transaction is final. I do so in case a reprint/correction is needed or a reship of a lost order is needed so the order will not have to be recreated. After the transaction is final then I wipe the encrypted order files clean from my drive with the Gutmann file erase method. In addition as stated in the shipping section above I destroy all postal receipts and keep the tracking numbers PGP encrypted and those are each erased with the Gutmann method as well once the transaction is final. Always stay behind tor. Do not save any info about your order to your pc after it is no longer needed. It is best to always keep messaging under PGP but is not mandatory. A simple to use alternative is privnote. Privnote is a not you write and message the recipient a link. The person opens the link in a new tab to read the message, the message can only be read once and self-destructs after being read ensuring info is not left in inboxes or messages. I advise all to delete their messages from the inbox and sent folder on here frequently. Any and all data and or files associated with Silk Road are kept under PGP encryption as well ensuring my pc is secured and will not be compromised. Any and all physical items that are scraps or bits of trash left over from orders such as a misprinted item are put through a paper shredder to ensure there is not any incriminating evidence on hand and that the buyer is protected. I pride myself in offering high privacy to my customers to ensure that they enjoy shopping here and enjoy viewing my listings and can have peace of mind knowing that their info is safe and secure during the order and completely eradicated after the transaction.</p>

<p>---------
<br />-PAYMENT-
<br />---------
<br />As the Silk Road Market Place rules and policies require the only currency and method of payment to be used is Bitcoins paid through the Silk Road payment system. This ensures that both buyer and seller have a way to ensure each does their part on the transaction and prevents scams from occurring, while allowing for people to have the ability to contest an order and solve any issues with admin support. If you do not pay through the approved required system then you lose the protection of escrow and are in violation of the market rules. I fully support those rules and believe protection for both parties is ideal and that Silk Road should get a percentage as we get the privilege to use their market. Please do not contact me and solicit alternate means of payment such as Western Union, Money Gram, PayPal, Dwolla, and outside Silk Road Bitcoin payment. Many people who solicit that can be undercover law enforcement and even if they are not, many vendors will pass that user's name around for all of us to avoid. We would rather be safe than sorry. Don’t even try. I have seen countless messages back when I was on SR 1.0 where they claim BTC is too hard to learn and use, or they don’t have the time to obtain the BTC and just need a one time buy because it is an emergency, or make all these claims that they will pay more; but the bottom line is I don’t care, BTC through escrow only!</p>

<p>In addition to only using BTC through Silk Road escrow I require all buyers to finalize the order in a timely manner. I do my job to process and ship your order. It is then the buyer's responsibility after getting the order to finalize the order and release the money from escrow to me. If you fail to finalize I will not hesitate to add your name to the "Buyer Blacklist" that all vendors have access to. This means if you fail to finalize then it is likely that no other vendor will ever do business with you and you will be forced to open up a new account and start rebuilding your stats from square one. The BTC is know to fluctuate frequently and when funds are left in escrow they may loose value meaning the vendors loose money on the order because of an inept buyer.</p>

<p>---------
<br />-CONTACT-
<br />---------
<br />At this time I will only discuss Silk Road business and Silk Road related topics here on Silk Road. I ask all customers do the same. For added security you can use privnote (https://privnote.com/) or PGP. Do not use email services to discuss or send data related to Silk Road as most email services scan and monitor emails and may even cut deals with law enforcement or governments to get an incentive or possibly a tax break to pass along emails that get detected by filters the government or law enforcement provide to the email companies. I am frequently logged in to Silk Road so I will get your message and reply as soon as I can. For added security as mentioned in an above section, delete your old read messages from your inbox and old sent messages here on Silk Road regularly, even if privnote or PGP was used. This way if your account is compromised or Silk Road is, then there is less intel they get linked to your username.
