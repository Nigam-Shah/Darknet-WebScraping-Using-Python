<p>———NEWS——— </p>

<p>AS OF FRIDAY APRIL 18 2014 (04-18-2014)</p>

<p>***UPDATE 04-18: We are working to ensure that all orders are sent out with the same level of quality while doing our best to respond to messages. We're not going anywhere so please do not worry about your order not arriving. We aim for one-hundred percent customer satisfaction and work with most concerns. We will be back to 100% normal speed this weekend, and as usual, all orders placed late Thursday-Sunday are generally shipped out with Monday's queue. </p>

<p>Thank you again for hanging in there as we get everything cleared away. We'll make sure to work with customers to ensure they are satisified (within fairness and reason).</p>

<p>Again - all orders placed from this point onwards are on schedule. Everything else is being cleared up now as it has been in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>*** 04-16: We're back. Sorry about the extended delay with our absense. As posted last Thursday to our profile, our team was away with very little connectivity. We were only able to access Silk Road through our secure measures for a few minutes and did not have a chance to respond to most customers. All orders placed are being worked through and will go out within the next business day or so. Orders that are older are sent out first as expected. We have a lot of messages to answer but our team does want to get you your product, so please be patient as we work through the backlog. We are going to disable the listing for about 24 hours to allow ourselves to catch up with the orders.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding. Please do not message us again if you are awaiting a response. We're going through them as quickly as possible. If you need something TRULY urgent, please send a message with the subject "URGENT" -- otherwise we will get back to you in a timely manner while working on customer orders.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>* Most orders made on Friday, Saturday and Sunday go out as normal with Monday's queue. *
<br />* All orders are generally on schedule. The majority ship within 24-48 hours of purchase (if not less). In general orders on schedule are shipped by the end of the second business day following the order. *</p>

<p>* PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING LESS THAN 5/5 FEEDBACK. WE STRIVE FOR EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STAND BY OUR PRODUCTS, SO PLEASE MESSAGE US AND WE'LL WORK WITH CUSTOMERS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS * </p>

<p>* NEW EXAMPLE PHOTOS OF OUR WORK *</p>

<br />__________</p>

<p>Welcome to our store. Production is on schedule, and shipment is within normal timeframes (by the end of the second business day, but for the most part within 24 hours).</p>

<p>__________</p>

<p>>>Our e-mail is identity@bitmessage.ch - please store this and our public PGP key offsite! &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>__________</p>

<p>* We are going to be offering insurance cards soon as a means of secondary ID. This should be rolled out in the coming days as we go through our finalizing on designing and will be FREE for a limited time with all orders. Any order that has already been placed will also be eligible for this offer when it is ready, and we'll send details as the time approaches (late Feb/early March). We will ship these to existing customers if they want them for free as well, so no worries on order placement. These are great, simple secondary ID's that you can use for additional verification. Order as usual from the listings and we will send you a message when this is ready by the coming week. *</p>

<p>* All orders of 3+ ID's will receive FREE USPS Priority mail. If you are ordering 3 or more ID's, please choose the USPS First Class mail option and we will automatically upgrade you to the Priority service. *</p>

<p>We answer pre-sales and support inquiries throughout the day and night. The response time may vary based on our workload, but we answer all inquiries within 12-24 hours. The majority of our messages are promptly answered within a much shorter timeframe on the order of 1-5 hours. </p>

<p>** Reminder: If you would like PGP- encrypted responses to your messages, please be sure to include your PGP public key so we can respond back! **</p>

<p>** If you are having issues with Bitcoin deposits to your account on Silk Road, make sure you click the "Check deposit address" link under your account balance page. Doing so every 30-60 minutes should eventually help the issue after it has cleared (this step is only if your deposit has gone through many confirmations and is still not showing in your SR balance). **</p>

<p>———PRICING——— </p>

<p>The pricing for our ID’s varies by the demand at any given time. We’re focused on quality and adjust the price as we feel to maintain a high level of excellence for all orders.</p>

<p>At the moment, we are having a very limited opening sale and ID’s are priced at just $109. The price will increase after the sale has ended and this will depend on traffic. During the sale, there will be no group discount, but we will offer a discount for larger orders in the near future. </p>

<p>Please do not let the low price during the sale fool you as the quality of our cards is top notch! See ‘FAQ’ for a much more detailed view into our product (99% of questions are answered there) - we promise you won’t be disappointed. </p>

<p>Duplicates are only $45 for a limited time and can only be ordered within 45 days of the original order. Please order the duplicate listing AFTER placing your main order and mention your name/main order number along with your address information (don’t forget to PGP!) in the address section of the checkout page. You can find the URL for our duplicate listing under the ‘ORDERING’ section.</p>

<p>Orders placed using the duplicate listing without the main listing first will not be honored and will be canceled.</p>

<p>We work within the escrow system but ask for prompt finalization after receiving your item(s). See the ‘FAQ’ more info on our policies.</p>

<p>———ORDERING——— </p>

<p>MAIN LISTING：http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/items/opening-sale-hand-crafted-high-quality-south-carolina-novelty-fake-id-holo-uv-scan-bend</p>

<p>DUPLICATE ONLY LISTING (see below):  http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/items/duplicate-only-listing-for-hand-crafted-south-carolina-id</p>

<p>Please use the following form when placing your order. This form should ALWAYS BE ENCRYPTED WITH PGP for security! Copy and paste the completed, encrypted form in the address field on the checkout page. Make sure to look at the photo guidelines below as it is a vital component to the ID. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you use your real name as it is easier to verify with secondary documents (such as a credit card) and prevents mistakes that originate from forgetting the name on the ID.</p>

<p>Please use an image hosting site of your choice (such as bayimg/imgur or a Tor-based uploader) for all photos.</p>

<p>—————</p>

<p>We have very realistic, varying handwritten-style fonts for our signatures, but we do offer custom signatures free of charge. Please clearly sign your name using a marker or dark pen on a blank white sheet of paper and include the link to the scan.</p>

<p>*** The quality of your ID is a *direct* correlation to the photo taken. While we carefully hand-edit your card, we work with the photo provided and we ask that some simple but key guidelines be taken to make the card look its best: ***</p>

<p>- PLEASE do not use a front-facing “profile photo” style image and use a sharp image taken with a camera or high resolution smartphone back camera only. Pictures taken in front of a mirror, for example, will generally result in poor image quality and are strongly not recommended 
<br />- Do not use textured backgrounds for the photo and use a clear background
<br />- Wear dark or contrasting (with the background) color clothing 
<br />- Please keep hair appropriately styled (within reason)
<br />- Do NOT use flash in the images as it tends to reflect but please take photos with proper lighting 
<br />- No editing on your end is needed. We will crop everything appropriately and would prefer unedited photos</p>

<p>Please format your shipping address as noted below, and remember to ALWAYS use PGP when placing your order:</p>

<p>FIRSTNAME LASTNAME      ----------------  [FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME]
<br />123 EXAMPLE STREET  ----------------     [ADDRESS LINE 1]
<br />APARTMENT 100    ----------------        [ADDRESS LINE 2 - OPTIONAL]
<br />NEW YORK, NY 10001  ----------------      [CITY, STATE ZIP (+4 OPTIONAL)]</p>

<p>We always print shipping addresses in a professional manner. Carefully check your address for errors. The name should match one on file for the address. We’ll do our best to catch any mistakes but go directly on what we are given and are not responsible for user errors. See the ‘FAQ’ for more info. </p>

<p>———SHIPPING/PRODUCTION———  </p>

<p>Our primary and preferred method of shipping is USPS First-class mail which is free with all orders. First class mail is very secure and we take stealth very seriously. First-class mail takes between 2-5 working days to arrive after shipment. We also offer USPS Priority mail shipping for $10. Priority generally takes 2-3 working days to arrive after shipment. At this time, we are a US-only vendor and domestic parcels are very well managed. Please see our shipping section in the ‘FAQ’ for more information about our shipping policies.</p>

<p>Production timeframe updates are always kept up-to-date on the top of our profile. We aim to ship out within 24 hours of order placement (excluding Sunday). See our ‘FAQ’ for more information.</p>

<p>———ABOUT———  </p>

<p>Although we are a new vendor on Silk Road, we have been in the general scene for many years. After exploring the various marketplaces, we quickly noticed the lack of quality novelty/fake ID products. Slowly, we worked on developing a product that took many months of modifications. We are well versed and researched in the art of novelty ID production. We witnessed the many unfortunate major events such as the fall of the original Silk Road and closure of BMR. We’ve quietly followed, working behind the scenes to further solidify the crafting process. We take pride in our work and make sure your ID is made and edited with precision and care.</p>

<p>The ‘FAQ’ contains detailed information about our store/product and we ask that you read it in full before asking any questions. Most can be found there with no issue. </p>

<p>———SECURITY——— </p>

<p>Security is paramount, and we take many vital measures to ensure the complete safety of our customer data. Without diving into much detail for safety, we take many precautionary actions and remain vigilant on a daily basis. Address information is NEVER retained after shipment and we utilize separate hardware with no outside network connection to produce the ID’s. In addition, we take rigorous measures for securely accessing Tor and communicating with customers. </p>

<p>For mutual safety, we ask that ALL customers PGP encrypt any sensitive information such as shipping addresses. While it is not required by Silk Road that all messages be encrypted, we encourage PGP for all communication. Privnote and other alternatives are not accepted - please take the time to learn PGP. It will soon be mandatory on Silk Road as a whole and is a simple but key part in user safety.</p>

<p>———INFO/FAQ——— </p>

<p>The following contains more detailed information about our shop. Please only contact us after thoroughly reading the FAQ in entirety. </p>

<p>- Do your ID’s contain all the security features on a real South Carolina ID? What about other states/custom orders?</p>

<p>Our hand-crafted ID’s feature mutli-spectrum holograms, UV, and have the proper 2D barcode on the back which ensures that they scan (tested prior to delivery, continue reading the ‘FAQ’ for information about scanning). In addition, we sufficiently test the ID before shipping to make sure it passes the bend test (continue reading the ‘FAQ’ for more on the bend test). Photos are edited carefully and drafted to provide a top-notch product, and we carefully review each product before shipping. Rest assured that the team at identity only crafts top quality products!</p>

<p>Along with security, we put a strong emphasis on product quality and at this time only offer South Carolina. Although we can handle it technically, we do not do custom orders. </p>

<p>- What is your printing process? </p>

<p>We can’t go into much detail about our printing process for obvious reasons, but we are not an fly-by-night operation formed overnight. Our cards are printed using thermal printing with similar equipment to the DMV and we never use inkjet-based printers for any of our processes. The templates themselves are a result of many hours of meticulous workmanship and all photos/signatures are inserted with care, edited closely to match that of a real South Carolina document. We utilize full multi-spec holograms, UV, 2D scannable barcodes as well as proper heat lamination to ensure physical quality. </p>

<p>- What about microprint?</p>

<p>Microprinting is produced at a resolution of about 1200 DPI and requires special equipment. No vendor on Silk Road can perfectly replicate microprinting and none have. We replicate it closely and the difference can only be seen through examination with a magnifying glass — something that a bar, club, or other venue will never use. We have never had an issue with the microprint feature on our ID, and we can assure all customers that our template is edited and printed to provide a very precise product.</p>

<p>- Does this scan correctly? I scanned mine and my friend’s fake PA ID scans a bit differently? Is there an issue?</p>

<p>Our ID’s contain fully scannable 2D barcodes. South Carolina does not use magstripe on their ID’s. They are encoded using the latest South Carolina data and the AAMVA specifications. Each state has a slightly different way of encoding barcodes in that the way results are displayed (such as height in inches or feet). We have tested our ID’s many times to make sure the data matches that of a real South Carolina and test that it scans on proper equipment before shipping.</p>

<p>We also take an important step in ensuring the ID’s scan in that we print our barcodes in 300 DPI, pure black resolution. As a result, the barcodes are always extremely sharp and this is important in some scanning equipment for reading the data. The ID’s also include a 1D barcode which contains a numeric serial number that is there for the DMV’s internal purposes. </p>

<p>As always we keep an eye on scanning technology and will update appropriately if needed.</p>

<p>- How about the bend test?</p>

<p>The bend test is varying by nature (please use common sense here), but we take an important step to provide protection against this. Real state ID’s (from every state) contain heat-sealed holograms which seal them to the card and provide a barrier against any bending problems. We carefully apply the holograms and a high heat-sealed transparent overlay to all our ID’s. This step is not done by the majority of vendors but makes a very significant difference in the bend test. We also do not use the standard 100% PVC cards that most use and instead use a card that contains a more flexible material within the central layer. These are the same type of cards that the state DMV uses for printing. The card looks and feels exactly the same and the material strengthens the card overall. There’s a photo of the bend test on our profile and it should show that we can more than sufficiently pass the  bend test on our product with ease. </p>

<p>- Is your template valid? Got any high resolution photos?</p>

<p>We have developed and rigorously tested our template for many months. We stay current with information and work to develop a very accurate product for all our customers. Everything is checked and editing is performed to ensure quality. The photo used on the ID is a direct correlation of the quality of the whole ID itself and must be taken carefully. Please see our ‘ORDERING’ section for important photo information.</p>

<p>We do not accept any birthdays under 21; these cards are a different template and we offer the 21+ product only.</p>

<p>Please see the following links for very high resolution versions of the photos of our ID’s. </p>

<p>- Where can I use this ID? Are there any 100% guarantees?</p>

<p>We take measures on our end to make sure that you receive a great product, but there are measures that we ask our customers to practice while using the product. This is not a real ID, and will not work for any “official” government or state-related affair. Namely, please use common sense and do not use your ID for things like opening bank accounts or crossing the border. Do not show your ID to a police officer. While our ID’s may work in these situations, we absolutely do not encourage usage in this manner. </p>

<p>Our ID’s are of proper quality to work in bars, clubs, etc. We perform all the steps needed to make a very detailed product (such as the security features and proper scanning) but know your limits. No specific guarantee is made as to where or when the card will work. We do offer duplicates at a very reasonable price which can be seen in the ‘ORDERING’ section above.</p>

<p>Our cards have been tested and worked for in state usage, but as a standard procedure we always recommend that these be used out of state (as all vendors do). </p>

<p>- What are your shipping and production timeframes? What are your basic policies? How about stealth?</p>

<p>We will always post the latest shipping time updates and other news on the top of our profile, but we complete all ID’s within one working day and ship within one working day. ID’s will ship out by the second working day and usually within 24 hours. Any changes to this will be appropriately updated and noted on our profile. </p>

<p>Our stealth is top-notch. Cards arrive with printed labels and business envelopes. We can’t reveal more information than that but rest assured that we take care of carefully packaging all products.</p>

<p>USPS First-class mail is our primary and preferred shipping method and is free for all customers. Delivery with First-class mail usually takes between 2-5 business days to most destinations. We also offer USPS Priority shipping for a small fee which generally takes 2-3 days once mailed. For security, we DO NOT give out tracking numbers. At this time, USPS Express Mail is not offered but may be handled on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p>Currently, we only ship to the United States. Any changes will be noted appropriately.</p>

<p>We offer a high quality product at a very reasonable price. We do not offer reships or replacements. We make sure the product is completely undamaged (correct data, scans properly, physical structure is intact/unbent) before shipping and package our items so that there is very little (almost a zero) chance it will be lost. We are not responsible for errors in shipping addresses or incorrect data on the card that was provided to us. Please ensure the name matches one on file with the address and double check before submitting. Always encrypt this data! </p>

<p>With that being said, we work with customers and maintain that communication is the number one step in resolving any issue. If any issues arise during the process in which less than a 5/5 rating is warranted, PLEASE message us and we’ll look into the problem promptly.</p>

<p>- Do you require FE? How do I contact you?</p>

<p>We work completely within the escrow system and kindly ask that customers promptly finalize and leave feedback promptly after receiving the item(s). Feedback is very important to us, and if there are any issues with the order we ask that you send us a message so that we can work on resolving the concerns. Shipping within the United States is very secure and the chances of a lost package are near zero. Please make sure to properly format your address as noted in the ‘ORDERING’ section.</p>

<p>Communication is paramount and we aim to answer all questions within 24 hours. Usually, though, we send out responses much quicker than that, generally within a few hours. Please use PGP for sensitive communication (and remember to include your public PGP key if a response is needed). </p>

<p>*Please use the Silk Road messaging system as the primary means of communication. If the Silk Road website is down, you can e-mail or send us a Bitmessage at the following address:*</p>

<p>E-mail - identity@bitmessage.ch </p>

<p>Bitmessage - BM-2cXMyykF7sZnAVGr6DZomuboc2yANewNvm</p>

<p>XMPP+OTR - we’ll be offering this support method very soon to customers. XMPP+OTR is an encrypted, real-time support medium over XMPP/Jabber that provides perfect forward secrecy. We will ONLY be providing OTR-enabled clients this option as all messages are securely encrypted and will provide further information in the very near future. We’re excited to offer this feature as it will provide real-time (instant messaging) support for our customers.</p>

<p>* ALL communication through e-mail or Bitmessage MUST be PGP encrypted for security. Messages that are not encrypted and sent through e-mail/Bitmessage will not be answered. *</p>

<p>We ask that you only use the alternate methods if the site is unreachable as we generally do not check these addresses as often.</p>
