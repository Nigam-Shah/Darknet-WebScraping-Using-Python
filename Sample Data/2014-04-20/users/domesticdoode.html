<p>IMPORTANT UPDATE 3/25/2014 - Spring fling sale is now over:) Hope you all enjoyed those prices, we will have another sale after out upcoming break. Keep an eye out! Thanks to everyone who has supported DD</p>

<p>IMPORTANT UPDATE 3/17/2014 - Ignore everything in my profile that pertains to escrow, if and when buyer feedback/reliable escrow/good customer support is implemented then all applicable statements below will go in to effect. We can only hope that this day will come soon! </p>

<p>IMPORTANT SALE UPDATE - XANAX PRICE HAS BEEN DROPPED
<br />3/4/2014 - 3/24/2014  $pring Fling Sale on Xanax Bars! Thank you for sticking with DD through hard times, we have dropped the prices as a thank you to loyal customers for helping us regain lost funds in these dark times. Enjoy!:) Also DD WILL BE TAKING A VACATION come the 9th of may 2014, until the 16th of may 2014. I will go on vacation mode, ship all orders, and WILL return. DD has many loyal customers and we look forward to re-sourcing product and returning immediately. Remember since SR 1.0 we have only taken 2 breaks, we try hard to stay constant, thanks for sticking with us! </p>

<p>IMPORTAN UPDATE 2/19/2014 (mail updates are below)::SILKROAD LOST ITS ESCROW, AND ALL MY MONEY IN ESCROW! SR HAS BEEN HACKED BUT ONLY MONEY STOLEN. ALL LISTINGS ARE NOW FE ONLY! Silkroad has removed the escrow system until it is deemed safe. For the time being, vendors that are trusted with high ranks are listed here -> http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=25105.0 -> All of these vendors are safe to FE with. DomesticDoode is on this list! :)</p>

<p>here is my part for the verified vendors for FE page->
<br />"domesticdoode
<br />Feedback: http://directory4iisquf.onion/node/1028047
<br />Product Offers: MDMA, Xanax, LSD, Cannabis, Hash, Mushrooms
<br />Email: domesticdoode@safe-mail.net
<br />Ships: Domestic Only"</p>

<p>--DOMESTICDOODE SHIPS STANDARD MAIL ONLY, PRIORTY/EXPENSIVE MAIL IS NOT AN OPTION FOR VERY SMALL INCREMENTS, WE APPRECIATE YOU USING DOMESTICDOODE--</p>

<p>                                                  ***</p>

<p>-------NOTICE! READ THIS! YOU AGREE BEFORE YOU BUY!---------------
<br />AT THIS POINT IN TIME NO REFUNDS UNTIL BUYER FEEDBACK IS IMPLEMENTED WHICH WILL BE SOON. Too many scammers trying to claim no arrival on tracking that shows arrived, clearly scams. The attempts have gotten out of hand even SR staff knows and is working hard to finish the resolution center/auto-finalize! I will redact this policy very soon once this system is implemented by staff.
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>                                                  ***</p>

<p>DO NOT PM ME ABOUT SHIPPING TIMES UNTIL YOUR PARCEL HAS PASSED THE 4BUSINESS DAY RANGE! SHIPPING TIMES REFLECT MAXIMUM ELAPSED TIME BEFORE MOST PARCELS ARRIVE!</p>

<p>-></p>

<p>PLEASE READ UPDATES BEFORE ORDERING! PLEASE READ EACH ITEMS' DESCRIPTION ALL THE WAY THROUGH BEFORE YOU ORDER! If you want answers, READ </p>

<p>->                                     Most recent mailing updates...

<p>UPDATE 2/20/2014 - All old updates removed to clear up some space. Things have changed a lot around here in the past week and as you can tell by the IMPORTANT UPDATE at the top of my profile(and on the SR homepage), SR has sustained quite the hit. All of my funds are confirmed stolen from escrow even if you finalized I cannot get the money until SR staff makes enough to pay us all back. I wish escrow worked and everyone didnt have to FE, but centralized escrow storage of massive amounts of money will always be prime target for hackers/etc. 
<br />Please be assured that nothing will change, the feedback you see on our profile will always represent us, and everyone is quite pleased in all aspects. It has been a rough time having communications cut off, the website changed/tampered with drastically, and funds stolen. DomesticDoode needs a little bit of time to recoup what was lost and get running full steam ahead once more. Just know that even with the new FE on everything policy, we are here to provide an honest service, and feedback shows this!

<br />DomesticDoode is back from SR 1.0, at your service.
<br />Please post a review if you order - >
<br />http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=8864.0
<br />Let us know how we are doing! We realize there is only 500 characters to leave feedback on the marketplace so feel free to post any long reviews to the fourms. Thanks again and remember I like to reward those who help us get the name out :)</p>

<p>Silkroad staff requires PGP encryption to order now! This has just come in to effect as of 2014! Please take the time to learn how to encrpyt messages using the public key at the bottom of my profile. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ORDER UNLESS YOU USE PGP!~! If you are unsure how to get started with PGP please refer to SR forums. Or see this guide! -> http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1qh266/ [[**WARNING CLEARNET**]]</p>

<p>If you are looking for safe, discreet, guaranteed domestic shipping then consider us your Doode. I guarantee all product will arrive as I use the latest methods of stealth, and I am known for fast arrival times. On 10 xanax and under(or MDMA pills) no tracking is used, therefore your forfeit your rights to any refund. I use a regular envelope so THERE IS A RISK of the pills being broken. This is a risk YOU MUST be willing to take in order for DomesticDoode to provide a safe, swift, and easy service. IF YOU ORDER 15 OR MORE PILLS I WILL USE A PADDED PILL POUCH SO THEY CAN ARRIVE IN-TACT. 100% Success so far! Of course my recent update about buyer stats applies, when SR implements buyer statistics and feedback all of the trusted buyers will never have to FE and will always be protected. (((UPDATE 2/20/2014 - ESCROW IS OFFLINE FOR A WHILE, PLEASE USE TRUSTED VENDORS, START SMALL IF WORRIED)))</p>

<p>DomesticDoode never touches the product, DomesticDoode just tells the little birds where and when to send the products. My little birds are always reliable and have been in operation for years. Small increments or large increments can be stealthily and easily moved all within a quick time frame. This allows for a large variety of products and premium quality control.</p>

<p>DomesticDoode works hard to maintain a steady reputation as we always have since SR 1.0 - PLEASE - PM us before posting bad feedback, with the power of escrow no one loses as long as you are a reputable buyer!</p>

<p>Let's keep this simple.</p>

<p>CONTRACT-
<br />When you BUY from US you are SIGNING and AGREEING to the following:</p>

<p>***DOMESTIC (_)SA ONLY***
<br />***TRACKING # which I will withold (in case of dispute)[NO TRACKING LOW AMOUNTS, see each listing to see what quantity qualifies for tracking]***
<br />100% Guarantee of arrival
<br />***Escrow always for customers with good feedback/reputation. NO FE EVER, I will look through your buyer history and decide on a case by case basis.(((UPDATE 2/20/2014 - ESCROW IS OFFLINE FOR A WHILE, PLEASE USE TRUSTED VENDORS, START SMALL IF WORRIED)))
<br />Secure PGP communication required by SR staff as of 2014
<br />Quick and friendly communication, I always PM back
<br />**No returns my product is quality
<br />**You can always find me on forums
<br />**All disputes will be handed over to SR staff, if they need to look at your address and match it to the tracking # info just to prove that you're lying ass recieved the product then I will leave it to them. Do not try to deny the tracking number we have heard it all before.
<br />**Do not dispute an item unless it truly has not arrived(which i will see) or unless you have over 500$usd spent & 5+ transactions(under this amount? then save the sob stories for SR staff)

Only complaint was the way the MDMA itself was packaged: it was sealed well and undetectable, but it wasn&#39;t rock OR capped, it was just stuck to the inside of its baggie. I scraped it off and weight seems on point. I&#39;ll be back!</td>
