  <p>4/19 ** Update***
<br />I am shipping from this site again!! So go ahead and order, there are many new items to be added within the week!</p>

<p>2-26***** UPDATE****
<br />As you may know SR was hacked by one of it's own vendor's and all btc were stolen
<br />( I believe around 6 million USD). I lost just over $2,500 because I allow escrow on all my orders. This is how most of the money was stolen, money
<br /> that was in cold storage aka. escrow funds. I have been vending for over 2 years and have proven myself a long time ago that I could require FE
<br />on all orders but I feel that buyers should have total faith in placing orders and not to feel they may be scammed. So I got screwed and the site has
<br />told me that they will pay me back but who knows. I have had a vendors account on Pandora for just over 3 months now
<br />( link- http://pandorajodqp5zrr.onion ) but also set up a vendor's account on Agora just about 6 weeks ago and think this site is going to be if not
<br /> already the best site there is. I dont know if you have seen it yet but it is very attractive looking and easy to use just like SR1 was. If you have not
<br />registered yet on Agora you need a referral to get on, Here is my referral link to register ( http://agorabasakxmewww.onion/register/T3oev04lLM ) 
<br />I only come on this site ever few days to see if any of the money that is owed to me is cleared and in my account. I am a faithful vendor of SR, this site is what got me started vending and will always be grateful for it!! I just am taking a break from vending on this site, first until I get reimbursed like I was told like I would, then also the auto- finalizing option need's to be in place. That is a must because I am a true believer in the escrow system, even though I have lost quite alot due to it I still care about the buyers to much not to offer it!  If you come to Agora and place an order with me, put in the address box that you were referred there from my SR page and you will get 1 free brand name Xanax that I list!!   Hey at least come take a look at Agora even if you dont place an order again with me, I am sure you will really like the way the site looks and many vendor's from SR are on there already and others are just waiting to be verified before they get there vendors account.
<br />When I first joined Agora there were like 2,000 drug listings and there is now like 5,700+ listings. I am still in the process of moving all my listings over there so if there is something you dont see that you know I usually list, message me over there and I will let you know if I have it in stock and will list or I may be out and can give you an approximate time of when it will be restocked. I still allow my listings to stay in escrow on both Pandora and Agora but think I may start requiring FE on Pandora, that should express to you how much I trust and believe in Agora. Here is another thing, my messages got so backed up on here that I just could not respond to them all but I do not let my message's on Agora get un-answered within 24-48 hours. I really hope that SR gets things sorted out and makes it through this tough time, the darknet market places would not be the same without Silk Road and we here at Pharmacare respect and support you!!!</p>

<p>UPDATE 1-16****</p>

<p>The site is having issues with quantity's on items for all vendors. I have had to cancel many orders due to buyers ordering items with the quantity at 0 or I have 2 as quantity and the buyer orders 10 but the site allows the order to go through. For example I have a listing that has a -45 as a quantity. So what I had to do as well as other vendors is put the price of that item at a ridiculous price so buyers do not order and other vendors do as well but that is why you see that and wanted to explain so you know why. I have brought this to supports attention so they know and say this along with other issues are being taken care of. Thanks

<br />Wow what a week for Pharmacare! Everything is fine and are fully stocked on about 80% of our inventory. We also are working to re stock on items from our partners abroad so many thing to come so make sure to keep checking with us. </p>

<p>                                                                                         Welcome to Pharmacare  «PC» ®
<br />                                                                                            -------------------------------------------- </p>

<p>  Hello everyone!! Well here goes round 3, first SR got shut down then Sheep is possibly going to steal all our coins and now back to where it all began, HOME and we all can agree, There Is No Place Like Home:)  Many know us but for those who dont let me tell you about us and how we work:
<br />   We here strive to make each and every Transaction you have with us an extremely fast yet pleasant experience, I mean who like's to wait but in return we ask you also to do your part and that is Finalize in a timely manor and leave your personal Feedback. Please make sure this is done and if any problems arise never hesitate to bring to our attention especially before leaving negative feedback, failure to do so can keep you from placing future orders or us being able to accommodate any problems!   We are a former vendor of SR for 15 months and member for even longer, we were in the top 15-20% for the majority of that time with 900 fan's, then we shot to the top on Sheep Market Place, but not going to go on like most vendors like to, this is a new beginning for us so the past is the past, we are starting over. We are as honest as they come and have the track record to prove it so, just place your order sit back and enjoy what you will experience. Thanks to all,
<br />

<br />We are officially open back on Silk Road and it feels great!! I sure am ready to serve and satisfy everyone out there.You will get the best service there is and shipping always goes out the next day if it is ordered on time.*** Depending on how business starts here on SR I may only ship 3 days a week until orders start coming consistently.I never will let an order sit more than 48 hours but I am not going to drop 1 order a day and sure you understand, I am sure things will take off fast though***</p>

<br />     
<br />    We are a Vendor in the United States and only ship within the continental United States. If you live in Alaska please pm us first to see if we will ship before ordering. We did ship Internationally so it was tried,  we apologize but between all the custom forms and the transit time we just dont offer it anymore. As most people know one of the top vendor's on SR that was caught had there investigation start from an intercepted package in route to Alaska, not saying that is the only reason why but due to the remote location and crossing another country (Canada) we have decided to not ship there anymore. 
<br /> We have been importing rare top quality products for about a year, items that are not usually available in the United States. With help from our partner The Scurvy Crew we get Ketama Hash which comes from Morocco, and Spanish Bayer Opium. We also have had Dutch MDMA shipped to us in bulk and may have some again soon, and are soon to get shipments from vendor Mseller from Europe who will supply us with Pharmaceutical Grade Methadone Powder of 90%+ which is amazing!! We have made it easy for you to enjoy these rare and special products without having to have an order go through customs and have them in your hands usually 3-4 business days after you place your order!!</p>

<p>Here is a link to our new review, please leave a post if you have ordered from us to let others know how we do business and about our products!!</p>

<p>-  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=5171.0</p>

<p>Here is a link to our old review:</p>

<p>-  http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37482.0</p>

<p>- The double zero hash is the best hash I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot from the road (RIP). It tastes so good, I had to write a huge review on it.  s to allow multiple items without paying shipping more than once.</p>

<p>-When ordering you can use the address box for any comments or requests, this will be seen before a message if short.</p>

<p>- All orders are tracked but do not send, this is to prevent scamming. </p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>                                                                                                               SHIPPING
<br />                                                                                                               --------------</p>

<p>          Before I get started on the shipping procedure I want to clear up something. Some do ask why Vendor's charge $10 for Priority Shipping when a Stamp cost's $5.80? I can tell you why we do, We provide 3 sometime up to 4 layers of stealth on orders. I am not getting into detail but anyone that has ever ordered from us would tell you this $10 is worth it for the comfort you have when ordering with us. For us to be able to purchase all the safety efforts we use on orders we have broken it down and feel it is more than fair to charge the extra few dollars on shipping that we do to make sure both the seller and buyer is safe. On SR we sent over 800 order's and can honestly say every single one was delivered. </p>

<p>   We only ship Priority Mail through USPS, there is no other way we do so do not ask, if you read about seizures of contraband in the mail system they profile Express mail over Priority plus the sending labels are hand written. We ship 5 day's a week and sometimes on Saturday. All orders are sent in something that will fit in any standard mailbox. Make sure to use a real name!!  Make sure you send us your address the same as it is when you receive a bill and how it is addressed to you. ***We vacuum seal then put in a MBB for everything except prescription pills***. We do not vacuum seal pills, there is no need to, we do send them in a bubble mailer that way you receive them in the same shape they were when sent. I assure you that all orders are protected in a few layers so if the envelope slightly was open there would be no suspicion, we have gained alot of experience in shipping and take great pride of 100% success rate with sending orders!! Hash orders are super sealed to prevent odor's.        YOU NEVER HAVE TO SIGN FOR AN ORDER!!!</p>

<p>-PLEASE DONT USE ALL CAPS FOR YOUR ADDRESS</p>

<p>-Use your real name!! Sending to fictious names or ones the post man does not recognize may be returned to sender and will not be our fault, we track every order!</p>

<p>-Use PGP when sending your address, its for your safety so use it!!</p>

<p>- Shipping address are to be in three lines (also no abbreviation for first name please), no General Delivery and no attention to, I am fine with P.O. Box's</p>

<p>- Any problems or non-delivery because you made a mistake with the address will not be my fault and why I try to cover all so no mistakes are made.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>                                                                                                  COMMUNICATE WITH SAFETY
<br />                                                                                                  -----------------------------------------</p>

<p> Safety is now something we all need to be more concerned with!! I advise that everyone use PGP when sending sensitive information(address when ordering). I will take orders in plain text, this is your choice and I have been very surprised with the amount of buyers still not using PGP. When using PGP only the individual sending the info and who it is intended to can read it. Not even the people who own/run this site can can see it, it requires a password for Decryption of the message. PLEASE if you are just sending a message on general questions use plain text!!! PGP take's some time to go through the whole decryption process and it is not needed for general question's, just use common sense when it comes to this and once again I cant stress this enough but always use PGP when sending your name and address for orders placed to anyone!!.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>                                                                                                               ORDERING
<br />                                                                                                              -----------------</p>

<p>Now that we have been vending for quite some time we have a method down that works very well.</p>

<p>- All orders have a cut off time of 12am. Midnite EST. , these orders in by that time will be processed and unless we are backed up will ship the next day.</p>

<p>- We then put your order in transit mode and only do so once your order is in the hands of USPS only!! </p>

<p>-Occasionally we can be backed up so please be patient and assure you that all orders will always be sent within 24-48 hours of receiving them. </p>

<p>-Once you see your order in transit you can expect to receive it in 2-3 business days. </p>

<p>-Those who have ordered from us know that we usually send an update that your order has been sent and when to expect it. (something you only get with us)</p>

<p>-We are true believer's of the escrow system!!  We only take orders through SR and only accept bitcoin for payment.</p>

<p>-When placing order and getting more than 1 item, choose addition to order, it's to allow multiple items without paying shipping more than once.</p>

<p>-When ordering you can use the address box for any comments or requests, this will be seen before a message if short.</p>

<p>- All orders are tracked but do not send, this is to prevent scamming. </p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Well I think I covered it all and open for business!! Hope to see you all again soon and Happy Shopping but most of all be   CARE-FULL EVERYONE!!!</p>
