<br />-Description- PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE LISTING BEFORE YOU ASK QUESTIONS OR ORDER
<br />-------------- Rx LABEL FORGERIES ARE COMPLEX AND THERE IS MUCH INFO TO LEARN
<br />This is a listing for forged Walgreens Pharmacy prescription labels. These are the label that is on the prescription bottle that your pills are in when you have a prescription filled. By law you can only have and carry prescription pills that you have a valid prescription for and must carry them in the prescription bottle as required by federal law. If you do not have a prescription or a bottle with valid label then you are committing a felony. If you obtain prescription drugs whether it be from an online anonymous marketplace, your dealer, a friend or other means you are committing a felony. This means if you are pulled over by police and you consent to a search, or they have probable cause to search you, once they find your prescription pills you will be arrested and charged with a felony. Another situation may be that you are drug tested for employment, drug tested for probation or parole, or searched by police due to probation or parole and they either find physical pills or you fail the drug test then you may lose your job if an employment drug test discovers it or be arrested if the discovery is by law enforcement. What these forged labels are is the exact same prescription label that appears on prescriptions from the pharmacy that are legitimately prescribed. When ordering you provide your name, the medication name, the mg dosage, the pill imprint, the pill color and the location or pharmacy info you want put on the bottle and I put the info on a prescription label and print an exact copy that is flawless and identical to a real prescription label in every way as I have blank prescription label templates that I created myself. You then place the label on an empty prescription bottle and you now have a way to carry and use prescription drugs you do not have a prescription for. If you are searched by law enforcement, no matter what the situation is you will not be arrested for having prescription pills. You will have a prescription label and bottle with your name on it with your pills inside! When police or a law enforcement officer sees the bottle they will simply put it back down and move on in their search. They are not aware of the concept of forged prescription pills as I am likely the only one in the world who does this as I invented this concept myself. These are also a way that dealers can carry around all of their pills that they are selling without any risk of being arrested or charged with intent to sell. If you are traveling then these are an ideal way to carry your pills through an airport, through customs, across border crossing, through train stations and you can do so without worry and without conflict with law enforcement. If you are arrested for having prescription pills and you do not have a prescription and did not have one of my forged labels then you can order one of my labels and have the date on the bottle back dated to before the arrest, then bring the bottle with forged label on it to court and the case will be dropped and you will avoid a felony charge and jail time. The same goes for a drug test. If you fail a drug test then simply order these labels and have them back dated to before the drug test I have been selling these since 2012 and these labels have never failed once. Many customers have used them with parole officers, used in airports when going through customs, used for drug test whether with police or for employment, these have passed when examined during a search by police and most important have passed in court with judges to get charges dropped. The beauty of these is you can openly carry your pills without worry. You can even consume your pills anywhere at any time without worry as you will be taking the pill from a prescription bottle, whether in public, amongst friends and family or at work you can consume without worry. Having your pills in an old film case, a mini ziplock baggie with some logos on it (apple bags), in a prescription bottle with the label torn off or worn off, or in some other unofficial container is a dead giveaway that you do not have a prescription. Even if you have an old prescription bottle from the past with a worn out label and a date that was months, maybe a few years ago with the medication name on it, will not be a consider valid by police or whoever else views it; you will need new labels with current date to be valid. Police will never believe that you have a prescription but the bottle is at home and “swear on my life officer I’m tellin you the truth I have a prescription” will never fly as they hear it every day and will arrest you. Make yourself arrest proof and purchase these labels, they are a cheap insurance policy that helps you avoid the potential thousands your will spend in court if arrested.
<br /> 
<br />Here is a compressed summary of how this works. You simply fill out the order form below with all the info such as your name and the pill info and then a set of labels with that info is produced and shipped to you. Based on your location I will put the proper pharmacy info on the label such as the pharmacy address and phone number to ensure it is authentic. The barcode(s) on the label will scan and read the info that is on the label. You will get a set of three prescription labels with your order, each label being dated a month apart so you will have three months of coverage and may choose any dates so you can back date it if you choose.
<br /> 
<br />---------------
<br />-Order Form-
<br />---------------
<br />Here is the order form you must fill out and submit with your order:
<br />1. Name to put on the labels
<br />2. Medication name
<br />3. Medication dosage (in mg)
<br />4. Home address
<br />5. Quantity of pills in the bottle
<br />6. Doctor name
<br />7. Pill imprint
<br />8. Pill Manufacturer (Pharmacy Company)
<br />9. Pill Color
<br />10. Dosage instructions (Ex: Take one tablet daily)
<br />11. Date (If getting a court charge dropped or drug test passed make sure to back date)
<br />12. Shipping address (Even if the ship to address is the same as #4, still provide it to ensure there are not any mistakes as some orders have different info for #4 and #12)
<br /> (Please include all info in all uppercase to speed up the order processing.)
<br /> 
<br />*This listing will get you the set of labels only. You will have to order the prescription bottle separately or supply your own. A listing for an empty prescription bottle without any label on it will be available to purchase. You can also take one of your old ones and use a solvent such as goof off or goo gone to remove the old label and apply the new one. Another option is to ask nicely at the local pharmacy for a spare bottle and say yours was crushed or broken and you have small children in the house who you do not want to get your pills, the pharmacist will have an image in their head of a child eating handfuls of pills and will hand over a bottle. I no longer include the bottle for free as given the volume of orders getting enough bottles from local pharmacies or ordering some will raise suspicion, this way each customer can recycle an old bottle or get one for free from the pharmacy. To replace the label each month simply use the solvent and a razor blade then apply the new one.
<br /> 
<br />*In addition to Walgreens prescription labels I also have CVS, Kaiser Permanente, Rite Aid and WalMart prescription labels available for sale. Simply check my listings to view and purchase them. This listing is for 3 prescription labels, however I offer a one year supply of 12 labels that is discounted. All other prescription labels come with the option of a 3 label set or 12 label set. The one year supply set of 12 labels is the best value making it so you are worry free for an entire year.
<br /> 
<br />☑ Important Ordering Information ☑
<br />Keep in mind that the large address box at checkout is actually just a large memo box. You can type in anything. This means for forgery items you will supply the completed order form that goes with the forgery and your shipping address if it is a physically shipped item. The box also allows for PGP messages to be inserted. Please ensure to supply all info at checkout instead of messaging it to me as it is preferred and more secure.</p>

<p>------------------
<br />-Additional Info-
<br />------------------
<br />I frequently get questions from users asking if they can order the listing and have each of the labels come with a different medication on each label. The answer is no, I will not do that. The reason is you would be paying the same price however I would be doing the work of multiple orders and you would essentially be paying for one order and getting multiples free. All forged prescription labels (and most forgeries I offer) are priced based on the labor involved and not the materials as materials are inexpensive, but the time and skill involved determine price. So if you need labels for more than one medication you must order additional order(s). These provide a very valuable result for a relatively cheap cost so making yourself arrest proof, passing a failed drug test, or getting felony charges dropped should be worth enough to you that you do not mind paying for the additional order to pay for my hours of labor.
<br /> 
<br />In addition to the above question many users have messaged me asking what if someone calls the number on the prescription bottle to verify if the prescription is real. The fact of this matter is law enforcement is mostly unaware of the fact that forged prescription labels are in existence nor are they classified as a serious threat. In fact it is likely that namedeclined is the only one worldwide who has developed this concept and sold it. Thus if a police officer comes in contact with this label they will not know to check to see if it is real or fake. They will simply look at the name and info on it and make sure the pills match what the labels says and move on in their search as they are trained to do. In order for them to check to see if it is a fake there would have to be a manual on how to spot a fake label and they would need to go through training and be certified for it for legal reasons. In addition medical information is private by law. So say for example a probation officer, a Judge, a police officer, an employer, or someone else calls the number on it and asks to verify the info, the pharmacist by law cannot give a yes or no as to if you are a real patient or if it is a real prescription. If they contact the doctor then the doctor will give the same answer. If a doctor violates that they can lose their license to practice and it is much like an attorney breaking the attorney client privilege, so you are safe if they try to verify the info. By law you are protected and all medical info is private unless you choose to make it public. Now if the health care in the U.S. becomes universal healthcare then the government would run it and laws may change, thus a court and police would be able to get a hold of your medical info, but as of now they cannot. In addition if a police officer ever does ask to search your home, your car or you, they cannot do it without your permission, probable cause, or a warrant. So if they ask then politely say no. They may say “Hey I just want to take a quick look, if you aren’t hiding anything what is the big deal?”. Still say no and maintain your rights. If they do have one of the reasons then these labels will save you from a felony charge and jail time.

<br />-Shipping-
<br />------------
<br />This item will be packaged and shipped in a discreet manner that will not draw attention. The item will have a tracking number to ensure and provide proof of shipment and delivery. The postal receipt will be shredded in a paper shredder and the number will be kept under PGP encryption for highest security. I advise that the envelope be destroyed with a shredder by the buyer or at least the address label, postage, and tracking number (alternate destruction can be used but shredder is preferred). The files used to make this order will be kept PGP encrypted and once the order is final it will be deleted along with the tracking number, both of which will be destroyed with the Gutmann method of file destruction. See the shipping and security section of my profile for all details.
<br /> 
<br />---------------
<br />-IMPORTANT-
<br />---------------
<br />These forged labels are not forged Rx pads. I do make forged prescription slips, however I only sell them to select customers who I approve to have them. These prescription labels will not get you prescriptions filled at the pharmacy. In addition it is against federal law for any scheduled substance such as opiate pain medication or benzo anxiety medications to have refills, so if you walk into a pharmacy with a prescription label for a scheduled substance that has a refill on the bottle and attempt to get a refill they will instantly know it is fake. On my forged prescription labels that have barcodes on them that scan, yes the barcodes will scan and the info will read the same info that is printed on the bottle, however it will not be in the pharmacy computer system as it is a fake label. It is just like a fake ID will not be in the police computer and can only be used in select ways, these can only be used in select ways. If you walk into a pharmacy with these they will detect they are fake once they are not in the computer. A pharmacy is just as secure as a bank as they know what they have is just as valuable. They have security cameras everywhere and will get footage of your face and your license plate in the parking lot. Not to mention your credit / debit card info if you use that and when they ask for ID for the controlled substance release that many states require they will have your name and ID number. You will be arrested, you will be charged and convicted of a felony. These labels are not for average intelligence junkies to get pills cheaply. Is it not enough for you to have the privilege of buying from deep web market places? In addition pharmacies have computer programs that exchange info with prescribing doctors and check to ensure a prescription s legit. Medications by law must be submitted electronically or by fax in addition to whatever you walk in with. Although these labels may not get you prescriptions filled they are still very valuable for all the reasons in this listing. Being safe from failing a drug test or being arrest proof by police is a very valuable asset to have on your side and a great card to hold in your hand. The only way these will get you pills is if you take them to a new doctor that will transfer over your medication from your old fake doctor to them will get you prescriptions written legitly. Many customers have bought these and taken them to doctors and then walked out with a prescription for whatever medication was on the forged labels they bought from me. Bottom line is these will not get you a fake prescription filled as I only sell fake Rx pads to select people I choose, but will get you a new prescription from a doctor who will take you on as a new patient.</p>

<br />✈Get Express Processing✈
<br />✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈
<br />If you need this item quickly I now offer a way to get express processing. If you order the express processing listing in conjunction with this listing, then instead of your order being processed after the other orders placed ahead of you; your order will be processed before any other order and shipped before any other order. This way you do not have to frantically message me asking for a speedy process and offering to pay extra, you can simply save time and just order the express processing. Please keep in mind that express processing does not alter the postage / delivery method option. Express processing will only get yours processed and shipped first, you will still need to select the proper postage option you want, so if you need it via EMS then select EMS when ordering, then order the express processing on top of that, this way digital orders do not pay for postage they will not use and buyers who only want priority or first class with their express processing can do so.
