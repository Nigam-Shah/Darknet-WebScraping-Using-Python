<p>Portable Trades and Occupations 20-20 - 10th Edition By Grandpa & Others</p>

<p>BONUS: How to Make A Million In Three Years Or Less - Think Like A Tycoon by Dr. W.G. Hill J.D.</p>

<p>► DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>www.portabletradesandoccupations.com</p>

<p>From the expat living legend known as "Grandpa"</p>

<p>Location: A sunny beach, somewhere far far away</p>

<p>Dear friend,</p>

<p>If you would like to make enough money to travel the world worry free, meet exciting new people, and live like a king (even if you’re in a 3rd world country), then this will be the most important message you ever read.</p>

<p>Here’s what it’s all about: in the expat world, they know me as “Grandpa”… because of my age, and because I’m very careful about giving my real name. The reason for this is simple: 42 years ago, an unfortunate chain of events forced me to flee the United States, with almost no money to spend, and to start over from scratch in an unfamiliar place.</p>

<p>I won't get into details as to why I'm not on Big Brother's Christmas list. Safe to say... in my books, I like to show people how to get a second passport... travel the world around... and legally pay NO taxes on the money they make. Big Brother hates that... I try to keep a low profile.</p>

<p>But this message isn't about taxes. It's about how you, too, can live the adventure of your lifetime abroad... without ever having to worry about money. How? By learning from my mistakes... and from the collected wisdom of hundreds of other successful expats I met in my journeys.</p>

<p>Here's just a glimpse of what you're getting inside this "reference guide" to financial freedom for expats:</p>

<p>• How to get successful business owners to split their profits with you… in exchange for a simple (yet little known) change you make to their website! (Anyone can do this – and that’s how an almost bankrupt college dropout got his first home in 3 short months!)</p>

<p>• The complete list of “evergreen” skills you absolutely need – if you want to be “in demand” wherever you go! (While locals are having a hard time getting a regular job.. you’ll be using this “expat’s edge” to make more money than you can count!)</p>

<p>• 5 fast-cash strategies to build your asset cushion in no time (if you’re newly unemployed, these strategies WILL put more money into your bank account – guaranteed!)</p>

<p>• Skip years of painful trial & error – by avoiding the one dangerous mistake most expats make on their path to a worry free, financially secure life</p>

<p>• The cash-saving strategy savvy business people know - yet 99% of wannabe entrepreneurs ignore, and risk putting their new business six feet under. 12 insider strategies for maximum income as a “perpetual tourist”</p>

<p>• A legal, low-risk technique for making monster profits in some of the poorest places in the world (proven tactic that will turn you into an offshore success almost overnight)</p>

<p>• The ultimate online business: no office, no employees, no product to ship! (get in almost “risk free” if you use this little-known tool)</p>

<p>• A very simple technique to double your income as an artist almost overnight (This astonishingly powerful strategy is well used by savvy artists… yet ignored by 95% of the people out-there…)</p>

<p>• How to get on the fast-track to a EU work permit and passport – without having to marry someone! (this particular country has the most relaxed immigration laws you’ve ever seen – and we name it in Chapter 2)</p>

<p>• Scouting for a second passport? Whatever you do – stay away from the 7 countries we name inside! (sure, their passports may look attractive… but if you’re not careful, they’re guaranteed to land you into hot water!)</p>

<p>• The best “mobile” trade for professionals: no license, permits or regulations – just huge, low-tax profits from one of the most scalable businesses in the world!</p>

<p>• How reading a local daily newspaper can instantly give you tens of hot money-making ideas… even if you just landed in a strange city and know no one!</p>

<p>• How to turn your most overlooked skill into easy cash while abroad (and an astonishingly simple way to instantly differentiate yourself from your competition… and command higher fees even on a cut-throat market!)</p>

<p>• An outrageously profitable home business that exploits a 1000% difference between local and overseas prices (charge 50% of what locals pay, and they’ll beat a path to your “virtual” door!)</p>

<p>• 10 proven Internet Marketing concepts you can use instantly to build a passive business that brings in huge piles of money almost on auto-pilot (While you're "busy" playing golf or working on your tan... your website puts cash into your bank account, day-in and day-out!)</p>

<p>• How one savvy expat’s love for helping orphans and lepers lead to a highly-profitable side business (he made a small fortune in just one year – enough for him to keep on traveling and helping people all around the world) </p>

<p>• How to exploit flaws in the local mail service for easy cash (powerful insider tactic to use your new “privileged status” to make maximum money in minimum time)</p>

<p>• Write your way to big bucks and an amazing lifestyle anywhere in the world – even if you think you can’t put two words together! (This particular “illiterate” turned writing into a $10 million/month business… will you use the same idea to make huge profits?)</p>

<p>• Get a six figure salary… and a hefty expense account at your fingertips… without ever doing a lick of work! (You’ll have all your expenses paid for by foreign governments… and command a six-figure income… for the single “responsibility” of throwing parties!)</p>

<p>• The shocking story of how Patrick became a passport broker – and turned his personal misfortune (and other people’s fears and paranoia) into a million-dollar-a-year business! (There’s room for more in this lucrative market – if you follow these insider tips!)</p>

<p>• Scandalous: How “Joe” built himself a small “art empire”… using highly-lucrative “black-hat” strategies (these devilish tricks brought a 5-figure windfall… and you can use them to make a small fortune – fast!)</p>

<p>• How a fresh-off-the boat Russian with broken English turned a simple idea into a multi-million-dollar empire (you don’t have to be a local… in fact… the more “foreign” you are, the better your chances of making it big!)</p>

<p>• How to become a local “sports god” – even if you’re a mediocre athlete! (Your new status will bring you generous sponsors, plenty of fans, and lots of ladies to entertain!)</p>

<p>• Get all your long-distance trips paid for – trading hard to find luxury items the rich desire. (An untapped “loophole” in the customs system translates into huge, risk-free profits for you!)</p>

<p>• The proven shortcut for breaking into the million-dollar newsletter industry! (You’ll finally reap the rewards of the “4 hour workweek” as a writer – for complete financial freedom – so you can work less, see more places, have more fun!)</p>

<p>• How to gain your financial freedom as a writer – without EVER writing  a single novel or even short story! (these little-known “specialty” fields are a lot less crowded – and sometimes more lucrative than having your own Amazon bestseller!)</p>

<p>• How to have 10,000 “virtual” salespeople at your command – for windfall profits, while working from your kitchen, in your underwear! (All you need is a computer and an Internet connection to get into this billion-dollar market that’s still ripe with opportunity!)</p>

<p>• The fastest way to make a 6-figure “windfall” with a home-based mail order business (get one prospect from 1000 to respond, and you’ll make enough money for multiple trips around the world… in your own yacht!)</p>

<p>• 5 ways to make more tax-free money as a “medical consultant” than you could ever dream before as an MD (imagine a field where there’s no litigation, no personal liability, and where the doctors you consult with take all the risk!)</p>

<p>• Make an easy $80k/ year (or more) anywhere in the world… as a graphics designer or programmer (a step-by-step action plan to bring you hundreds of generous clients… for a steady cash-flow each month!)</p>

<p>• Take advantage of international price differences – by learning how to “arbitrage” in the commodity market! (You can easily become a small-scale Warren Buffet... if you follow these insider tips!)</p>

<p>• Get big publishers to pay you for traveling to exotic places. 14 sizzling topic ideas big magazines are paying BIG money to get their hands on!</p>

<p>• If you like detective stories… here’s how to make a million bucks a year by tracing missing heirs! (When people don’t claim their inheritance… you could be easily and legally grabbing a nice share of a huge estate!)</p>

<p>• Make $5 for every letter you receive – with your own business secretarial service! (You’ll be paid to stay at home… and do nothing else than simply forward other people’s mail!)</p>

<p>• How to get into importing and exporting… without buying anything with your own money! (Even if you make mistakes… there’s a sneaky way to make sure your budget NEVER  takes a hit – so you can build a rock solid experience and a steady profit, risk free!)</p>

<p>• How to turn free commercial samples into a 6-figure paycheck (this works particularly well when exporting clothing from low-wage countries!)</p>

<p>• How to find lucrative deals at trade fairs (and the fastest way to position yourself as an importing/exporting expert… so you’ll get a contract signed almost every time you’re negotiating with someone!)</p>

<p>• The single most powerful secret for success in any portable business. Ignore it at your own peril… but use it, and you’re guaranteed to make more money than most expats out there!</p>

<p>• Get on the fast-track to becoming a highly-paid MC or event organizer… and make big bucks promoting rock concerts, seminars, or even Shakespeare play readings… following this simple yet complete “walkthrough” (“super-star” organizers routinely make $250k per weekend… and it’s easy to break in, even if you’re a complete newbie!)</p>

<p>► Excerpt from page 361: </p>

<p>“Female Companion Wanted for Uninhibited Adventure on an Uninhabited Tropical Island, Must be Personable, Intelligent and Fit”</p>

<p>This may not be the exact wording of his ad, but Gerald Kingsland, according to the London Observer apparently places personal ads like this in London newspapers or magazines every few years. There is no shortage of genuine respondents. Gerald, who looks to me like an old fart, and who is now well over 75 years of age, always gets an attractive lady in her twenties as his honeymoon-without-marriage companion. These days you can place such an ad on “Seeking Arrangments” or “Sugar Daddies” or “Sugar Mommies.” My previously mentioned buddy, Pepe Telaramus uses such ads all the time with excellent results. I always assumed that old farts had to pay for play. Apparently not. They can be paid!</p>

<p>We thought we had heard of everything in the way of unusual lifestyle options, when this item came to our attention. Apparently it is easy for a guy or woman who has survivalist skills to recruit one or more companions to go away with them to play Robinson Crusoe or Swiss Family Robinson. Apparently, the ad-respondents are willing to finance the travel expenses and buy all the survival gear needed as well. The Observer reported that Kingsland always gets about four or five dozen female applicants, bored with the urban rat race. They are willing to go off on an adventure that is pretty much as advertised. Many of the applicants, after an interview and no doubt a little soft sell in the sack are willing to pay all or most of the expenses. After spending the past 20 years with companions obtained in this way on different islands off New Guinea, South America, South East Asia, and the South Pacific, Kingsland has left London again, setting off for an uncharted island with latest companion.</p>
