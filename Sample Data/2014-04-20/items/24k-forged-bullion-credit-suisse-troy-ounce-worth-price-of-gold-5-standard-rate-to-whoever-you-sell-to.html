  <div class="container container_large" style="margin: 20px 0 40px;">
    <p>4/15/14 OUT OF STOCK MORE SOON (dont know when since I never know when hes ready to deliver). Def cant hold for anyone. Price raised accordingly. Dont message me about you were "going to buy it" when the price is low I have more stock when its high its because im almost out and dont know when im getting more. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>*I do not provide tracking unless you do not recieve it 3 days after the morning you order. My shipments go out in the AM each day and 2 day priority for all. So dont ask me for tracking unless it has been 3 days. 90% of the emails I get are for tracking information and im not divulging my origination location. If you dont recieve your item in 3 days email me your state and i can typically figure it out by username and give you a partial screenshot!</p>

<p>I GET A MILLION QUESTIONS A DAY FROM THESE FROM MOSTLY NON BUYERS, SO IM GOING TO ADD SOME FAQS:</p>

<p>Where do I sell these? Pawn shops or gold coin stores</p>

<p>Should I use ebay? almost always no, it is tied to you and people buying are experts and have all day to look at shops they have minutes and when you read below they will think you are a sucker so they speed it up esp if you say can you check the worth quick I have like ten mins just stopping on my way to x. Put time constraints on them.</p>

<p>Should I use Craiglist? CL is very good you get individual collectors, can use fake email names, set a place to meet and time, not give a number or use a burner phone, Plus once they buy it if they say its fake after the fact whose to say they didnt swap it on you as an argument. I also suggest placing listings for any coins I have listed to see what kind of response you get then you will know there is a market.</p>

<p>How do I know what these coins are worth what you say? firstly if you cant use google how are you on this even hahah, secondly and real answer call a coin guy (not one in your market since you dont want it tied to you per say even by phone number) Call and describe my headline for each coin as what you have. They can tell you a value or ballpark on the phone.</p>

<p>Should I use fake ID? I would always reccomment buying one that scans on here. Dont get pulled over and let a cop see it though, that could bring you down and actually almost happened to me yest. Keep it off you til traveling with goods.</p>

<p>What if they have cameras? Leave the market or city you are in and use a fake ID that scans on here under physical forgeries section</p>

<p>Do all pawn shops take ID? Pawn Shops do, yes, because many of the goods there are stolen and a federal mandate makes them catalog items so police can search online for robbed or stolen goods they are not hunting for people selling this, Cops HATE pawn shops, they live when pawn shops are ripped off because pawn shops buy stolen stuff off drug addicts all day so they laugh when pawn shops get ripped off most pawn shops wont bother reporting it because they know how much of an investigation will ensue. This is why I prefer Pawn to coin or gold dealers any day if possible although both work pawn is always safer in my opinion. Also never sell anything worth over 10k to a pawn or coin shop they have to write a check over 10k. So be smart with selling amounts.</p>

<p>Are these Laser Etched: Yes, they each have a unique verifiable clean serial #</p>

<p>Do coin shops take ID? Nope, unless its over 10k then they have to write a check.</p>

<p>Will they know it is fake? Unless they do a deep scratch test (in which they have to ask your permission then no! If they scratch it without your permission or look like they are about to say "are you about to damage that? Do you even know what it is some of the worth is in the mint, give it back Ill take it to someone who knows what they are doing" It passes acid tests (which they dont do either)</p>

<p>What if I am arrested? Plausible deniability (means that if you went to court it could be believable that you had no idea it was fake, if you were in court and they had no proof other than you had a fake product and they couldnt prove where you got it but you were trying to sell it would you see that as enough to convict somebody? If you have a mildly good back story, willed, found (prove that it wasnt), traded it for goods or services, bought it on craigslist awhile back with an email you forgot in a different market, be creative. Remember in America they need to PROVE that you had knowledge that it was counterfeit if arrested just because you try selling it doesnt prove you know a thing, unless you want to tell them you bought it on SR hahah! FYI: ive never heard of anyone arrested for this but people ask so im addressing.</p>

<p>Why are you selling these if they are worth so much? Because traveling gets old, between coins and these I've been all over and it was definetly fun and I still do it on occassion if Im going on vacay or to see a friend and I still unload some in nearby cities but not the quantity I used to. I sell some, give some to friends and sell the rest on here since im fortunate enough to not have to work anymore due to several things.</p>

<p>Can I get a discount if I buy a lot? I will do 6 for the price of 5. 12 for 10 and we can talk from there. I dont have enough in stock usually to even cut deals like that but sometimes I do it all depends on the week or month.</p>

<p>How should I act when selling these? With bullion or coins you want to play dumb and make these assholes think you are a sucker. So what I do is dress as scummy and unkempt as possible. I go in to the store and I ASK THEM WHAT THEY ARE WORTH that would be like you having a PS4 and asking me whats this worth and really meaning it id be like eh I think $150 or so. Sounds like a good deal if you dont know the worth but those things are like $500. Same principle here, the way you word it is imperative. And I repeat "I want to see what this is worth, this is the first place I stopped so just thought i'd see" (to them sucker alert and they think they have an idiot on the hook, that is half the battle right there maybe 90% of the battle actually) You are making them the authority on what its worth and they are going to offer you, its ridiculous but it works like magic that is why you dress like scum. So they will come at you with a $1000-$1200 mark (only had $1000 a couple times) so they make an offer then you say "wow really, would you buy more than one? I didnt want you to price all of these together so I had you do 1 but I have 5 more (or whatever)" again they think JACKPOT! And you pull out the rest from your pocket. Again never make it more than a 10k figure I keep it 4-6k myself at one place. Ill also ask whyll they look at it if I could trade it for items in the store if they want it (with no intention of that just showing them they might get trade and even more value to them) or Ill say could I do a loan on this if I needed (again makes them think you think its real since a loan would mean you want it back) if they wont buy but will do a loan, screw it and take the loan if its like $800 or so (at least I would in my lazier end years).</p>

<p>Behavior: Be calm cool, look around, dont fidget, hands out of pocket (subconscious sign of hiding something), small talk, talk about its your first time in a pawn shop, talk about wow people sell some crazy shit, just distracting but more seeming calm, cool and collected, remember you have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>What if they call it a fake: Kill them immediately, jk. Say "I knew I should have went to a gold and silver buyer, can I have my fake bullion back (sarcastically, shaking head) then mumble shit under your breath. Or do the nice guy thing " wait are you fucking kidding me? how do you know, how can you tell? My friend traded me this for my ps4 said it was worth over a thousand im gonna kill him! Are you sure its fake? How can I show him its fake? Is there a gold or coin shop you reccommend for me to verify this? (but dont let them damage it more to prove it, again scratch test is the only way they will know).</p>

<p>Selling on craigslist: Safest way without ID and least knowledgeable people is Craigslist. But dont sell it dirt cheap. Look up golds price (usually around $1400 then subtract 5-6% from that that is what a gold store would take as a cut) so what you do from there is divide that number by 2 (usually the gold store takes $80-$85 as there profit) so you list it at 2-3% gold price, therefore making you (in the buyers eyes, trying to make an extra $40) So it makes sense. If you list it for $1000 or something ridic every red flag in the book will go up and it will be scrutinized. The reason you are selling on CL if anyone asks is because just lie and say "gold buyers want like $100 less than its worth screw that" say "$40-$50 is $40-$50 half days pay or whatever if you want to seem like a broke ass) Craigslist is easy just use a tormail account if need be if you are paranoid or burner phone or just set time and place to meet in email and phone is dying so you will just be there at said time.</p>

<p>What does it weigh: 31.1 grams on the nose! Same as any other Troy ounce anything!</p>

<p>What is it made of? Covered in 24k gold with a metal that will remain nameless for certain reasons (other people attempting to make) that weighs what we need it to to pass the weight test, basically the only test pawn or coin dealers do since it looks so perfect and they see so many they dont think twice, its like do you think twice when someone hands you a 20 do you scrutinize it, obviously these are worth more but people think they can just tell by looking and weighing and that is where we and hopefully you win!</p>

<p>Ok Ive covered a lot if you buy one Ill help you as much as possible. Some people ask a million questions though of no relevance please do some homework on conning as that is all you need to know since the gold itself takes care of itself.</p>

<p>I am selling Forged Royal Canadian Mint Gold bullion it is 1 troy ounce it is plated but they do not do scratch tests on these since some of the value comes from the design. They weigh it and it is dead on with weight then make you an offer. Gold goes for about $1400 right now. If you go to a pawn shop or gold buyer and say "im trying to see what this is worth" (pretend you dont know the worth) and that this is your first stop. They will try to lowball you for around $1200-$1300. I pretend to think about it for a minute or I say "it's really worth that much???" and say sure Ill take the money. Sometimes Ill just show them one get there offer then pull out a couple more. You never want to sell more than 10k at a time worth or they write you a check and Cash is indeed king. I find smaller amounts at a time 3-4 seems more feasible.
