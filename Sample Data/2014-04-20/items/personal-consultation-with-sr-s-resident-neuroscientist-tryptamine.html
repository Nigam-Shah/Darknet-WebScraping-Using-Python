  <div class="container container_large" style="margin: 20px 0 40px;">
    <p>I am a biologist who specializes in neurochemistry. Since the early days of the first Silk Road I sold proprietary nutritional supplements on the silk road to around a thousand customers with 100% positive feedback. My products each contained over a dozen maximally bioavailable vitamins, adaptogenic and neuroprotective herbs, and metabolites. The ingredients had high therapeutic ratios and synergistic effects, allowing for the use of relatively low dosages and no reports of adverse effects in two years. Dozens of customers left detailed reviews on the forum, reporting a wide range of beneficial effects - reversal of long-standing brain damage, perceived improvements in cognition and mental endurance, attenuation of adverse drug effects, alleviation of anxiety and stress, facilitation and enhancement of sleep, and dependence on pharmaceutical drugs. I am also an expert on cognitive enhancement in neurotypical individuals.</p>

<p>In addition to selling my one-size-fits-all products, I also gave advice to customers (and even non-customers) who came to me seeking it, suggesting natural, inexpensive, legal therapies. Everyone who left a review reported that my advice or products changed their lives for the better.</p>

<p>I stopped vending here a few months ago. I may return someday - for the time being I am semi-retired. However, I enjoy using my knowledge and understanding to help people, which is how I ended up on this site. I've therefore decided to return to giving advice (at least for the time being).</p>

<p>Purchasing this listing enables you to ask as many questions as you want in one message, as well as a follow-up. I will try to answer within two days. After at least a week, if you feel that my advice was not worth the money, I will refund you the difference between what you paid and what you think it was actually worth. In the rare case that I cannot adequately answer or advise I will give a full refund. I have not received a question which I could not at least partially answer.</p>

<p>The following is only a miniscule fraction of the reviews I've received for my products, and some feedback I've received for my advice.</p>

<p>MINDFOOD</p>

<p>The Mind-Food is great for the MDMA comedown. In fact, any sort of comedown. Either that, or its a brilliant placebo :)
<br />-Kappacino</p>

<p>Tried it loved it.
<br />Interacts and enhances the clarity realm.
<br />Prevents the forget loop which occurs in benzos.
<br />-Herbaman</p>

<p>Have been taking the mind food every day.  Feels very nice definitely increasing my mental energy and have had better cognitive thinking so far. Thanks Tryptamine!
<br />-LSDANK</p>

<p>One dose of MindFood eradicates a hangover much faster than paracetamol and/or ibuprofen.
<br />-Rolling Stone Magazine, Australia</p>

<p>I preloaded with the new mind food yesterday one hour before taking some MDMA and MDA... today I woke up energized with an amazing afterglow and felt that way for most of the day, a vast improvement.
<br />...
<br />I've been using Mind Food before my NBOMe trips; they prevent me from feeling tired and drained the next day.
<br />-l1llykins</p>

<p>I feel much more alert and my ability to concentrate increase. Thanks!
<br />-unbelievable</p>

<p>I will re re-ordering when I run out. I feel great.
<br />-Userspace</p>

<p>These caps work quite well, I could definitely notice a better mental awareness and capacity the day after using draining or intense drugs. Definitely recommend if you ever feel 'foggy headed' or can't concentrate on something the day after.
<br />-?</p>

<p>I was invited to an apartment party by a group of friends who were all going to roll... Anyway I took my point orally and smoked some and went to the party and had a few drinks. Basically I was riding a good buzz and having a great time. I stayed up until 3am rolling, and at the end I was pretty tired. I went home and took a MindFood, a ChillPill, 5mg of melatonin, and my postloading regimen, then went to bed.
<br />The next day I had absolutely no drain, no hangover, nothing. I had restful sleep and felt great! I definitely feel that the MindFood helped.
<br />-Poolsclosed</p>

<p>I can say for certain that my hangovers are significantly reduced.  I feel like I'm recovering much quicker and keeping my brain sharp.</p>

<p>When it comes to my health I can't put a price on that, so although these pills are expensive, they are very much worth it.
<br />-spinbox1</p>

<p>CHILLPILL:
<br />(http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4dc5679867)</p>

<p>I took a chillpill the other night, and had a very nice relaxed sleep.
<br />-Atlas (vendor)</p>

<p>Wow, Tryp. Amazing. Your Chill Pills are truly amazing. I'm in love with them.</p>

<p>I took one last night, and I had taken another two nights before. I definitely slept better, felt better rested, and had much more vivid dreams. It's true what you said about the pills not forcing you to sleep as well: though I fell asleep very easily, the pills didn't make me any more drowsy or tired like Ambien does. Also, unlike Ambien, they don't give me an early-morning hangover.</p>

<p>They are the best sleep aid I have ever used, and I've tried several over the years. Every single one so far (even the ones that didn't even work) has had annoying side-effects, but your Chill Pills don't seem to have any at all.
<br />-Horizons</p>

<p>excellent supplement for general mental and mood support.</p>

<p>The Chill Pills are really helping me sleep, without the terrible side effects of the Benzos, which even in small doses - I hate them -</p>

<p>Thanks.
<br />-CGault</p>

<p>Successful order, took one and was feeling relaxed shortly after. Thanks Trypta.
<br />-Tryptamaniac</p>

<p>Have found these helpful in the past when my sleep cycle gets off phase; they don't mess with SWS like benzodiazepines, they don't have the rebound and other issues that GHB does. And in my attempt at a blinded trial on 1 person (me), they were effective as far as reduced time to sleep onset. Thanks again.
<br />-SybilVimes</p>

<p>Great pills. Relaxes your body without causing drowsiness so it helps you sleep but doesn't force you. Should be very good for stress too.
<br />-lanius</p>

<p>Took one last night. It helped quite a bit with my sleep. I feel much more refreshed!
<br />-Userspace</p>

<p>the other day I was getting pretty stressed out about some things going on, and decided I'd try one out (this was close to the time I went to sleep).  I didn't really know what to expect, but after a while I started feeling less tense, and the physical effects of my stress seemed less intense.  My mind was still whirring about some things, but physical I was feeling much better.  After a while I drifted off to sleep and I had some pretty vivid dreams that night.  I don't remember my dreams very often, it was pretty cool.  I'll try more in the future and follow-up this post.  Thanks for offering these, Tryptamine!
<br />-WerfelGB</p>

<p>I have found that it makes a great comedown tool for stimulants and that it reduces anxiety well when combined with DPH.

<p>TRYPTAMINE:</p>

<p>tryptamine has helped me out a couple times with health related questions.
<br />Always replied to my pms within a day, and took the time to explain stuff to me.</p>

<p>All in all, he's a VERY good vendor and I recommend him to everyone who's been hesitant to place an order.
<br />Thanks again tryptamine :)
<br />-Atlas (vendor)</p>

<p>.. you're a very odd mix of highly educated phrases and bizarrely skewed perspectives, you know that, Tryptamine?  Oh well.  I like you all the same.
<br />-SelfSovereignty</p>

<p>Thanks for all the advice. Really, thank you, it's highly appreciated. :) ... I do feel a lot healthier.
